<p>How much of a language barrier is there still in the 21st century? You, as the reader, are probably very familiar with English, but what about others?</p>
<p>Nowadays, most of us have often heard the importance of accessibility, better performance, and better UX or DX. You might not hear or often see about i18n compared with these topics. But if you see facts and numbers from the statistics, you might find some surprising results about i18n and its impact. Let’s find out about that together.</p>
<h3>i18n And l10n</h3>

<p>Before we go through the impact of i18n, let’s learn the difference between the two terminologies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>i18n</strong><br />i18n stands for internationalization. Between the first character “i” and the last character “n” from this word, there are 18 characters. i18n describes implementing the structures and features for your applications to be ready to localize content.</li>
<li><strong>l10n</strong><br />l10n stands for localization. Between the first character “l” and the last character “n” from this word, there are ten characters. l10n means translating content into the languages for users who are accessing from specific regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a follow-up, i18n contains a programmatic process to implement features for content editors and translators to be able to start the l10n process from the UI.</p>
Why Does i18n Matters That Much?

<p>To see the importance of i18n, let’s look at the numbers and statistics for objective information. You will see the numbers of some facts below, and before reading further, let’s guess what those numbers stand for.</p>
<ul>
<li>5.07 billion</li>
<li>25.9%</li>
<li>74.1%</li>
<li>China</li>
<li>Asia</li>
</ul>
<p>The first fact shows a tremendous amount of the numbers. 5.07 billion is the number of users in this world in 2020. The world population in 2021 was 7.837 billion, nearly 8 billion. More than half of the world's population has access to content on the internet and apps.</p>
<p>Based on the number of users in this world, there’s another research about the most common languages used on the internet. Looking at the chart, most of us pay attention to the highest number on this diagram: 25.9%, English.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/internationalization-i18n-right-remix-headless-cms-storyblok/1-common-languages-internet.png" /></p>
<p>The second highest is the rest of the languages, 23.1%. Also, suppose you gather the rest of the percentage except English. In that case, you may realize out of the over 5 billion users, 74.1% of the users are accessing the content in any other language.</p>
<p>After going through these facts, we can now talk about why internationalizing and localizing your content for Asia and China, in particular, is crucial. China has the most internet users worldwide. As a result, more than half of all internet users globally are from Asia.</p>
<p>Based on what we saw, probably, we can not ignore localizing content. It will improve UX if these huge amounts of users worldwide could have localized content. After knowing the potential impact of proper i18n, let’s look at the fundamental logic.</p>
How i18n Works At A Basic Level

<p>Regardless of the technology to implement i18n, there are three ways to determine languages and regions. </p>
<ol>
<li>The location of the IP address</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</a> header/<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages">Navigator.languages</a></li>
<li>Identifiers in URLs</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the IP address detects the region of the users and allows them to access content in their regional languages. However, the users’ IP address does not necessarily match their language preference. Moreover, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites?visit_id=638090932378616963-37385648&amp;rd=1#geotargeting">location analysis prevents the sites from being crawled by search engines.</a></p>
<p>Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</a> header or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages">Navigator.languages</a> is another possible approach to implement i18n. However, this approach provides language information but not regional information.</p>
<p>i18n is not just about localizing content. It includes improving UX as well. For example, creating identifiers in URLs enhances UX. It also helps to divide localized content into the dedicated system. We will cover how it’s possible to implement such a system in the “<a href="#a-combination-of-remix-and-cms">A Combination Of Remix And CMS</a>” section.</p>
<p>Typically, identifiers in URLs exist in three different patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Differentiate by domains (i.e. <code>hello.es</code>, <code>hello.jp</code>)</li>
<li>URL parameters (i.e. <code>hello.com?loc=de</code>)</li>
<li>Localized sub-directories (i.e. <code>hello.com/es</code>, <code>hello.com/ja</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>To follow the same-origin policy for better SEO, localized sub-directories can be used.</p>
<p>Based on the interesting facts and the fundamental logic for implementing i18n, we’ll talk about frameworks and libraries, as some of them use i18n libraries.</p>
Libraries
<p>In order to not reinvent the wheel whenever we want to implement i18n into our projects, developers have different libraries, tools, and services that can be used to facilitate the work. If we are working with React or React-based frameworks, we have different options available. Let’s talk about some of them.</p>
<h4>Format.js</h4>
<p><a href="https://formatjs.io/">Format.js</a> is a modular collection of JavaScript libraries that we can use to implement i18n logic in both the client and the server. This group of libraries is focused on formatting numbers, dates, and strings. It offers different functionalities and tooling and runs in the browser as well as in the Node.js runtime. It integrates with various frameworks, like Vue and React, so that we can use its functionalities on our Remix projects. You can read more about it on the <a href="https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/">official React Intl's docs</a>.</p>
<h4>i18next</h4>

<p>Another alternative that we can evaluate for our project is <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>. This JavaScript library goes beyond the standard i18n features, providing a whole suite to manage i18n in our projects. We can detect users’ language, cache translations, and even install plugins and extensions. As it was built in JavaScript, we can use this tool for websites as well as for mobile and desktop applications.</p>
What About Remix?
<p>When creating a website using Remix, we have different options to consider. As it is a React-based framework, we can use any of the previously mentioned libraries. However, we will go through two approaches that can fit better in your Remix projects. First, we will see how to localize content using remix-i18next, a Remix specific library for i18n. Second, we will use a headless content management system as the source of our content’s different languages/locales.</p>
<h4>remix-i18next</h4>
<p>Based on i18next, <a href="https://github.com/sergiodxa">Sergio Xalambrí</a>, one of the main Remix contributors, created <a href="https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-i18next">remix-i18next</a>. This library offers similar features and modules as the JavaScript library but focusing on Remix concepts and approaches. Easy to set up and use, production-ready, and without any requirement or dependency. Let’s have a closer look at how to implement i18n into our Remix projects using remix-i18next.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to install some npm packages:</p>
<pre><code>npm install remix-i18next i18next react-i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector i18next-http-backend i18next-fs-backend
</code></pre>

<p>All of them will help us to manage i18n on both the server and the client side of our website. We will also use them to set up our backend and define the logic that will detect the language from the user.</p>
<p>Now, we should add some configuration that will be used across the website from both the client and the server side. Let’s create a couple of JSON files with the translations of the different character strings that we’ll use on our website:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "intro": "Hello everyone!"
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>{
  "intro": "Hola a todos!"
}
</code></pre>

<p>By naming the files “common.json”, we’re defining the namespace for the strings that we’ll list in them.</p>
<p>Now, let’s create a file called <code>i18n.js</code>. This file contains different configuration settings that we’ll use at the moment of initializing our i18n server.</p>
<pre><code>export default {
  supportedLngs: ["en", "es"],
  fallbackLng: "en",
  defaultNS: "common",
  // Disabling suspense is recommended
  react: { useSuspense: false },
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can see more configuration options in the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options">official i18next docs</a>.</p>
<p>Now, create the file <code>i18next.server.js</code>, which contains logic that will be used in the <code>entry.server.jsx</code> file of our Remix project.</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>import Backend from "i18next-fs-backend";
    import { resolve } from "node:path";
    import { RemixI18Next } from "remix-i18next";
    import i18n from "~/i18n"; // The configuration file we created

    let i18next = new RemixI18Next({
      detection: {
        supportedLanguages: i18n.supportedLngs,
        fallbackLanguage: i18n.fallbackLng,
      },
      i18next: {
        ...i18n,
        backend: {
          loadPath: resolve('./public/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'),
        },
      },
      backend: Backend,
    });

    export default i18next;
</code></pre>

We’re basically initializing a new i18n server that will run with our Remix backend. We’re specifying the location of the JSON files containing the translations to be used.

Let’s add these features to our main Remix config files. First, we add some logic to be able to translate content client side. To do that, let’s edit our <code>entry.client.jsx</code> file:

<div>
 <pre><code>import i18next from "i18next";
import LanguageDetector from "i18next-browser-languagedetector";
import Backend from "i18next-http-backend";
import { I18nextProvider, initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
import { getInitialNamespaces } from "remix-i18next";
import i18n from "./i18n"; // The configuration file we created

i18next
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(Backend)
  .init({
    ...i18n, // The same config we created for the server
    ns: getInitialNamespaces(),
    backend: {
      loadPath: "/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json",
    },
    detection: {
      order: ["htmlTag"],
      caches: [],
    },
  })
  .then(() =&gt; {
    // After i18next init, hydrate the app
    hydrateRoot(
      document,
      // Wrap RemixBrowser in I18nextProvider
      &lt;I18nextProvider i18n={i18next}&gt;
        &lt;RemixBrowser /&gt;
      &lt;/I18nextProvider&gt;
    );
  });
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We need to wait to ensure translations are loaded before the hydration in order to keep our web app interactive.</p>
<p>Let’s add the logic to the <code>entry.server.jsx</code> file now:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>import { createInstance } from "i18next";
import Backend from "i18next-fs-backend";
import { resolve } from "node:path";
import { I18nextProvider, initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
import i18next from "./i18next.server"; // The backend file we created
import i18n from "./i18n"; // The configuration file we created

...

export default async function handleRequest(
...
) {
  // We create a new instance of i18next
  let instance = createInstance();

  // We can detect the specific locale from each request
  let lng = await i18next.getLocale(request);
  // The namespaces the routes about to render wants to use
  let ns = i18next.getRouteNamespaces(remixContext);

  await instance
    .use(initReactI18next)
    .use(Backend)
    .init({
      ...i18n,// The config we created
      lng, // The locale we detected from the request
      ns,
      backend: {
        loadPath: resolve("./public/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json"),
      },
    });

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    ...

    let { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(
      
        {" "}
      ,
      ...
    );
    ...
  });
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Identifying users’ preferred language will allow us, among other things, to redirect them to certain routes.</p>
<p>Now we can start using the functionalities provided by remix-i18next to detect the user’s locale and deliver translated content based on that. Let’s edit the <code>root.jsx</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>...

import { json } from "@remix-run/node";
import { useChangeLanguage } from "remix-i18next";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
import i18next from "~/i18next.server";

...

export let loader = async ({ request }) =&gt; {
  let locale = await i18next.getLocale(request);
  return json({ locale });
};

export let handle = {
  i18n: "common",
};

export default function App() {
  // Get the locale from the loader
  let { locale } = useLoaderData();
  let { i18n } = useTranslation();

  useChangeLanguage(locale);

  return (
    &lt;html lang={locale} dir={i18n.dir()}&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/html&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>useChangeLanguage</code> hook will change the language of the instance to the locale detected by the loader. Whenever we do something to change the language this locale will change, and i18next will load the correct translations.</p>
<p>Now, we are able to translate content in any route:</p>
<pre><code>import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

export default function MyPage() {
  let { t } = useTranslation();
  return &lt;h1&gt;{t("intro")}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use the <code>t()</code> function to show translated strings based on the list of messages that we defined in our JSON files. </p>
<p>In this example, we use one default namespace, but we can set up multiple namespaces if we want. You can read more about the <code>t()</code> function in <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/api#t">the official i18next docs</a>.</p>
<p>In case we want to translate content server side, we can use the <code>getFixedT</code> method inside our loaders and actions:</p>
<pre><code>import i18next from "~/i18next.server";

...

export let loader = async ({ request }) =&gt; {
  let t = await i18next.getFixedT(request);
  let title = t("intro");
  return json({ title });
};
</code></pre>

A Combination Of Remix And CMS
<p>Together, we explored the available options to implement i18n with Remix. At the beginning of this article, we learned that i18n could result in hugely improved UX and SEOUX, and SEO. As part of UX, it’s also important to include better DX.</p>
<p>The approach above creates translation files at the source code level. Also, we don’t have the logic to implement identifiers in URLs. To achieve this, let’s look at the approach of integrating a CMS. In this article, we’ll use Storyblok, which offers three different approaches to localizing content and handles to determine the languages and regions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>If you want to create the connection between your Remix app and Storyblok, there’s <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-remix">a 5-minute tutorial</a> that explains just how to do that.</em></p>
<p>After that, you can quickly clone a starter space by using this magic link to have all the necessary components and field types. This example space covers an approach called folder-level translation. We’ll cover what it is about in the next section.
<a href="https://app.storyblok.com/#!/build/181387">https://app.storyblok.com/#!/build/181387</a></p>
<h4>Choose Between Three Approaches</h4>
<p>Storyblok has three ways to create the layout to store localized content and determine languages and regions.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.storyblok.com/docs/guide/in-depth/internationalization#folder-level-translation">Folder-level translation</a>: Divide localized content in folder-level.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/I228iqqNz0E?t=138">Field-level translation</a>: Translate in field-type level.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.storyblok.com/docs/guide/in-depth/internationalization#space-level-translation">Space-level translation</a>: Dedicate spaces (environments or repositories) into certain localized content.</li>
</ol>
<p>To cover identifiers in URLs, folder-level translation works perfectly, as each folder will only contain relevant localized content.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/internationalization-i18n-right-remix-headless-cms-storyblok/2-storyblok-folder-level-translation.png" /></p>
<p>Also, identifiers can be modified from the folder settings via the slug.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/internationalization-i18n-right-remix-headless-cms-storyblok/3-storyblok-folder-settings.png" /></p>
<p>By modifying the slug from the folder settings screen, this localized identifier in the URL appears in all stories inside this Japanese folder. For example, the about page inside of the Japanese folder already has a localized identifier in the URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/internationalization-i18n-right-remix-headless-cms-storyblok/4-storyblok-page-teaser.png" /></p>
<p>To programmatically generate content pages, Remix has a feature called <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#splats">Splats</a>, catching all slugs regardless of the nested levels. Naming a file <code>$.jsx</code> will enable the catch-all slug fundamental function.</p>
<pre><code>app
├── root.jsx
└── routes
    ├── files
    │   └── $.jsx
    └── files.jsx
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#dynamic-segments">dynamic segments</a> from Remix is that splats still match at the next <code>/</code>. Therefore, splats will capture everything in the path. If the URL path is <code>hello.com/ja/about/something</code>, the splat route has a special param to capture the trailing segments of the URL. </p>
<pre><code>export async function loader({ params }) {
  params["*"]; // "ja/about/something"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using the splat route’s special param, let’s edit <code>$.jsx</code> file.</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>export default function Page() {
 // useLoaderData returns JSON parsed data from loader func
 let story = useLoaderData();
 story = useStoryblokState(story, {
   resolveRelations: ["featured-posts.posts", "selected-posts.posts"]
 });
 return &lt;StoryblokComponent blok={story.content} /&gt;
};
// loader is Backend API &amp; Wired up through useLoaderData
export const loader = async ({ params, preview = false }) =&gt; {
 let slug = params["*"] ?? "home";
 slug = slug.endsWith("/") ? slug.slice(0, -1) : slug;
 let sbParams = {
   version: "draft",
   resolve_relations: ["featured-posts.posts", "selected-posts.posts"],
 };
 // …
 let { data } = await getStoryblokApi().get(<code>cdn/stories/${slug}</code>,
 sbParams);
 return json(data?.story, preview);
};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>HINT</strong>: <em>In the section “Choose between 3 approaches”, we didn’t cover all three approaches, but if you’d like to know more, all approaches are documented below.</em></p>
Summary
<p>We learned together the facts and statistics to know the impacts and the importance of i18n and saw how Remix handles several options to implement advanced i18n. Interestingly, a better i18n experience provides better SEO and UX. Hopefully, this article provided you with new knowledge and insightful learnings.</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mwichary"><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/smashing-podcast-episode-57/marcin-wichary-250x250.jpg" /></a> Vitaly Friedman: He’s a great designer, excellent writer, and wonderful engineer. Originally from Szczecin, Poland, he used to work as a design lead and a typographer at Medium. He was a fellow of Code for America and a UX designer at Google working with the Chrome search and homepage dual teams. He now works as a design manager and editor design lead at Figma in San Francisco. He studied at West Palm University in Szczecin, and completed his doctoral in human computer interaction in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and also in Amsterdam. Apparently, he speaks at least — well, that’s from what we know — six languages including Polish, Dutch, and a little bit of English. Now he is extremely obsessed with many things, but most notably link underlines, typesetting, fonts, and guess what? Typewriters.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So we know he’s a great designer with a keen eye for typography, but did you know that Marcin is a former Polish handball goalkeeper, and after hours he likes to force his friends to watch Sneakers, over and over and over and over again. It’s like Groundhog Day all over again. And he managed to put Pac-Man on Google’s homepage. My Smashing friends, please welcome Marcin Wichary. Hello Marcin. How are you doing today?</p>
<p>Marcin: I’m smashing, but the handball players... That was funny. There’s a guy whose name exactly like me, who’s a handball player.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, I thought it’s you. Marcin, this could not be coincidence. He looks like you.</p>
<p>Marcin: Kind of looks like me. It’s funny because I’m sort of little sour because he has a Wikipedia entry and I don’t. But also there are these cool YouTube videos of people chanting his name like Marcin Wichary. And I sometimes play them and pretend that that’s me.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But I’m sure that there are wonderful listeners who are listening to this very recording right now... They’ll be more than inspired and excited to create a Wikipedia page for you, just need to tell us about your story, all the things that typically go in a Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Marcin: When the Wikipedia learns about this collusion here. I don’t—</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s okay. I think we’re all safe here. We have wonderful friendly people listening to us. Marcin, it’s such a pleasure to see you again. I mean we haven’t seen each other for.. a long time. You spoke at SmashingConfs a while back as well, and it’s such a pleasure. You never change, do you? You never change. One thing that really excites me about you is that you are really obsessed with things, but in a good way. I mean, not in a bad way, right? In good ways. And I’m wondering, maybe it’ll be a good start just for you to briefly share your story. Where did it come to be? Did you want to become a web designer when you were growing up?</p>
<p>Marcin: Oh, that’s a great question. I’ve heard this... So the answer is probably no, in as much as web design didn’t exist when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Marcin: For kind of an aspiring little nerd, I got pretty lucky because my dad had this sort of dream job at the moment, which was repairing arcade games and pinball machines. And it’s fun because it’s obviously games, right? It’s nice to be able to go into the arcade and play for free in early nineties or mid-nineties. But it’s also fun because you can kind of open them up and see how they’re built. And that I think was what got me hooked into, "Oh, this fun was designed, made by somebody." And you can look up all of the assets, you can open the pinball machine and poke your finger at things and—</p>
<p>Vitaly: Which is, of course, what you did.</p>
<p>Marcin: I did, yeah. I highly recommend it if you have a pinball machine next to you, ask them to open it up and show you. There’s so much under the play field. And that sort of led eventually to computers and kind of programming and I think as many people probably, I felt like I was just a bad programmer who got distracted by phones and colors and recreating UI elements.</p>
<p>Marcin: And eventually much later I learned this is actually something like what I’ve been doing. It’s called UX design or interaction design or whatever you want to call it. And that became kind of my thing, but not before I actually invested in a lot of becoming a programmer, because I thought that’s the closest to where I was. And so I backed into the... There’s the classic should designers code question, which we shouldn’t really talk about it because it’s unanswerable. But I kind of walk myself back into it by accident. I was a programmer first and I kind of became a designer with all of this programming baggage. Which actually ended up being kind of at least useful in my line of work.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But I mean one thing that’s really interests me most of the time is that I had a very similar story as well when I was growing up. Because I remember there was no thing, becoming a designer, you just do some web stuff and then you kind of webmaster in a way. And one thing that I noticed many of my friends who were moving into design and this web thing, they came from everywhere. They were doing all different things. Some of them were building glasses, the others would be architects, the others would be writers. And it was this incredible moment of almost a wave, a very strong wave of just people from all over the place coming in. And it felt like you are more... You are just becoming something new, something entirely new.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So it’s like you used to be that person, then you’re becoming a new person. Do you feel, and this is moment of transformation, at least this is how I experienced it, did you feel the same way? You’ve become somebody else over time or you just grew naturally into this role being interested in everything digital? And obviously we’ll talk about also some of the technology. Ancient or I would say... Not ancient maybe, but vintage technology. So I’m really wondering just what brought you to that specific place. You could be doing so many things, not just programming, not just design. There are all those things.</p>
<p>Marcin: It’s a great question and it’s something I’ve obviously been thinking a lot about, because it’s attention between two things. One is have having a plan. I want to become this person, I want to do those things. I want to invest in that. Which you can and probably should have to some extent. But I think more of my career has been reflection on what things meant to me, and what excited me, and what I gravitated to, and seeing what more I can do with that and how I can connect it to other things. Like to give you a specific example, I joined Medium back in the day because it just seemed like extraordinarily cool, and huge kind of focus on craft, a small team, a very beautiful but also meaningful product that kind of helped people write. Which felt important to me, always felt important to me. But in the process of it, I started writing more and more in a different way.</p>
<p>Marcin: And I think Medium was actually kind of important for me. You joked about me knowing six languages, which I only know two very well and a few poorly, but at that point in my life I still wasn’t really sure if I can write in English, because my original language is Polish. And Medium got me over that hump. It got me comfortable with English enough and then I started writing about this typewriter stuff and people started reacting to it and at some point I was like, I connected these three things. One was I’ve always wanted to write a book because my mom was a librarian and I thought books is the biggest thing you can do in your life. If you write a book, you paid your dues on this planet. And then I crossed some sort of a threshold where I could do it in English.</p>
<p>Marcin: I felt for the first time English is my language. And then I found a thing to write about, completely by accident. So I think for me it's, I’ve never really felt there was an inflection point that I became a new person. But in hindsight I always kind of look at those connecting things and saying like, "Oh, should I invest more in typography because I seem to be really into fonts." But I didn’t know I was. I don’t know. Maybe at some point pinballs are going to be back and I will be the pinball guy. I don’t know, that’s probably not going to happen. But that’s kind of often how I thought about it. Think a little bit about what you want to do, but also connect the things that you already have, at least worked for me.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. I mean one other thing that really interests me is that we all get super excited about technology. We all are almost possessed or obsessed I would say by this notion, "Oh, we can do things faster and we can do things better." And what I learned is that although we try to make things faster and we try to make things better, the humanity is still incredibly busy. We used to think that technology is going to help us and we’re going to be doing less and we’re going to be just a little bit more relaxed in life. But it seems like we’re doing more and more and more with that technology.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But what I really like and what really gives me a little bit of fascination I guess, is that you are always looking back. You are almost obsessed with old technology. I mean, probably also with new technology, maybe I’m wrong here. But I’m wondering is something wrong with modern technology that you are almost spending most of your time with the old one?</p>
<p>Marcin: What isn't? Yeah, I mean there’s always something wrong with technology. I think we go through these cycles where we get excited and then we reevaluate it. I think crypto just went through this phase. I mean honestly, as much as I think you and I both love the web, there are probably some moments where we’re like, "Oh, was this good for all of us, or did it create some challenges?
But I don’t think Tim Berners-Lee is just universally happy with what came of web. But I think generally, I can’t say the old... I want to actually very specifically avoid, "They don’t make them like they used to," kind of line of thinking because I don’t think it’s particularly helpful.</p>
<p>Marcin: I think for me a lot of it is about connecting the past into the future and remixing it. Literally this week at my work, I will probably use some things that I learned in my research for the book about the keyboards, because keyboards are still around and typography is the same. Typography kind of has all of these waves and existed for hundreds of years, and you can grab things from the past and you have to be careful, because nostalgia is incredibly powerful but not always useful. And you can see what still makes sense and what can you learn from the past, and what you can throw away, or what needs to be revisited. Because there’s a lot of baggage there. I don’t know how much... I was just thinking about this. Do you know Playdate, the little game machine with the crank?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Marcin: They made it, I think last year. Shipped it exactly at the pandemic time, so it slowed them down. But it’s this beautiful little device. It’s a handheld device with games with a monochrome screen and this kind of strange user interface. But what I really like about it as a statement is that it tries to negotiate with nostalgia. It’s not just an emulator of an old game. It’s more sort of looking at a past and saying, "What of those things that we moved on from were actually interesting and better." Maybe the limitations of a monochromatic screen with fat pixels is something interesting for creativity. Maybe a device that’s sort of small and dedicated to one thing, it’s great and we kind of lost it over the years. But I also say we want internet connectivity. We want a really nice metal device that feels great.</p>
<p>Marcin: It’s this figuring out how to recombine those things. And I think that’s ultimately very important to me. That was the same story with Underlines at Medium. It wasn’t that let’s be forever indebted to the gods of typography from 200 years ago, who designed a perfect underline. Because that’s really not that exciting. I mean it is from the craft perspective, but it was really interesting, like how do we make links that look beautiful, because then you want to link to more things. And linking to more things, it’s just a very, very powerful thing that you can do.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And a very unique thing that we can do. Interactive media as well, right?</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, and I was inspired by just people who write in a way... That’s what I miss sometimes of writing for "paper." That you cannot link to things. Because that’s just like-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, we have footnotes.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, yeah. But you cannot... Do you remember John Syracuse’s MacOS 10 reviews? They were on Ars Technica for many, many years. Every time a new MacOS 10 came out.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I remember. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Marcin: And he linked all over the place, and it was just genuinely inspiring how much it changed the way you could read actively.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, but do you think Marcin, I mean I kind of keep coming back to this actually, for the last couple of weeks. Somehow I remember vividly this notion of imperfection when I was growing up. So I assumed that we have a similar age and I remember viewing all these TV shows, and the conversations and the broken, semi-broken internet connection, and pretty bad phones and all these things. And it felt so human to me somehow. Like, "Oh, of course this thing is broken." And that’s fine.</p>
<p>Marcin: And I feel like these moments of almost serendipity, I guess. I mean, I’m not trying to be nostalgic here just for the sake of being nostalgic, but I have this feeling that maybe we have too much of what we actually want these days, in terms of technology. So you can watch anything you want with the click on a button. There is this notion of, you don’t have to go anywhere. Everything is right here.</p>
<p>Marcin: But then I kind of liked this moment. I watched one of the silly nineties movies, and there was this moment where you would go to this VHS store and you would pick up the VHS tape and you would have an endless conversation with your friends about what are we going to watch, without actually watching a trailer of it. Kind of imagine what it’s going to be. And I feel like, "Oh wow." I don’t have that experience anymore. We just pick something up based on IMDB score and call it a day.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, I think we are figuring out what this sort of abundance of things means to us. I think there’s a parallel argument you could make, and I think some people made, that for example, Twitter with its sort of virality and outrage and all of that, is just an expression of, we were never meant to be connected to so many people so intimately. That’s just not how we’re wired. The Dunbar number exists for a reason, and I think hopefully we’ll figure it out. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I’m very optimistic about that. I’ve always been.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah. I think you can see even in the wake of Twitter news, people trying to think... Maybe the sort of small curated set of blogs that I follow is actually a little bit more human, like you say. Maybe the Google reader was right all along. And so hopefully we’ll adjust and figure out what is that sort of human moment on this scale of zero to everything.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But I also think the human technology, I want to see more of human technology. And I think that’s in some way the hub. Actually, this is a nice segue to your work. Like the Figma editor, where you see cursors coming in and moving around and doing things together. I always feel just a little bit of excitement when I see cursors moving in and people coming in, and a few more of us just play around, and they do these things and sometimes it’s broken and sometimes this isn’t kind of... I don’t know. Sticky note or whatever.</p>
<p>Marcin: It’s just falls over the cliff or anything. But I like this notion. It seems like this is really something that really connects me with people all over the world, just the cursors. Maybe you could actually speak a little bit more about what exactly you’re working on than the Figma context. I noticed you’re working on the core, the heart, the classic Figma editor, but specifically keyboard shortcuts, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, I’ve become the keyboard person also at work because, for obvious reasons, I guess. I joined Figma almost five years ago, and originally I was one of the designers. I work on the first version of auto layout and a bunch of typography things, selection colors, which I think turned out well. And a lot of smaller things, because I think we hope that Figma is also a lot of smaller things done well, and a lot of big things done well and they coexist.</p>
<p>Marcin: These days I’m moved towards being a manager, so I’m basically trying to help other people who are more talented than me to make those things happen. They’re working on really, really impressive features that you know might have seen already or you will see later this year. It’s all in the... We call it the editor, the classic Figma. And as for the keyboard, yeah, it’s kind of funny how it’s haunting me in a way, because Figma is kind of the productivity app in a way. And in some ways it’s actually really old school, if you think about it.</p>
<p>Marcin: It’s in a modern context, it has multiplayer on the web, but it really has right-click menus and a bunch of the... And again, it’s a negotiation with nostalgia in a way. It’s like how much of this is good, how much of this we need to revisit every day? And the same with the keyboard, because keyboards are still the tool if you want to do a lot of things really quickly. It’s kind of miraculous how they were not built to be that tool originally, maybe. But it’s still probably the best connection between your brain and the outside world, is the keyboard. So we are constantly, "Where do we put these keyboard shortcuts?" And there’s so much history of keyboard shortcuts that you have to negotiate. "What do we do with this modifier key?" Which we constantly run off modifier keys. That’s like an ongoing joke.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, that’s not surprising. Even just how many keyboard shortcuts you already have.</p>
<p>Marcin: And how many things. It’s like the classic Doug Engelbart thing. It’s just one of the most beautiful things happens when you have one hand on the mouse and one hand on the keyboard. If you watch somebody use Figma or other power tools really well, it’s incredible. And yet, it’s funny how Doug Engelbart tried to invent his own device for the left hand, or if you’re right-handed for the mouse, which was a key set, a special device.</p>
<p>Marcin: But we don’t have that. We use the keyboard with the other hand, and the keyboard is not really designed that well to do that, because of the combination of modifier keys and a mouse. So that’s always... It’s funny, my job is in a lot of ways, it’s the same sort of historical research as my book, except put in a very different context. Like Shift + A for auto layout. That’s a shortcut we invented, right? In a way for Figma. It didn’t exist, but we were just... First of all, we were lucky that it was free, because Alt + A is already art board, Command + A is already select all. And you could argue Shift + A is actually not the proper shortcut because shortcuts are not supposed to start with Shift, except we all started doing this a few years ago because we run out.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I would love to be in that meeting where you’re actually deciding, "Okay, so we need to find a new shortcut. So this is how we’re going to this." I’m just curious, how do you even run that meeting? So let’s explore all the options we have, or it needs to be connected in some way or the other with what we’re trying to do here.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, it’s funny. You don’t want to be... It’s hard. I’m just going to say it’s really, really hard, because there’s just so many limitations. And I think the really hard part about keyboard shortcuts or anything revolving around motor memory is that you can’t really negotiate it. Once a keyboard shortcut puts itself in your fingers, it’s really hard to get it out of it.</p>
<p>Marcin: There’s this great research I learned of a long time ago, probably a century ago, they had a person who learned how to touch type, and then he moved on to do other things with his life. I think at this point it was still possible not to touch a keyboard for years or decades. So he touch typed for a while on the typewriter, and then for 25 years he did nothing. He had a secretary who typed for him. And they put him in front of the typewriter like 25 years since he last wrote, and he just typed. It wasn’t as fast as 25 years, but it was sort of miraculous how quickly he got back into typing really, really well. And then they did it again 25 years later.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, that’s quite the experiment right there.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah. There was a funny... They just found this person, and because things just installed themselves in the motor memory in sort of really beautiful ways, in a way. That’s how we can walk, that’s how we can chew gum, that’s how we can do all sorts of things. And that’s how we can type.</p>
<p>Marcin: For some of us, not to make it very dark, but at some point in our life, you might forget who you are, but you will still be able to type, because that’s a different part of our brain. So if you are used to Command + S to save, if you’re used to Command + A to select all, if you used to Command + B to make something bold, that’s non-negotiable, more or less. It’s really hard to take that shortcut away and put something else in its place. So it’s very easy to just keep adding shortcut, but it also is tricky because there’s only so many keys.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, because it’s wrong.</p>
<p>Marcin: ...those slack conversations, and I have some guidelines internally to Figma, but it’s just really hard. Every time, it’s just a really long conversation where you feel like you cannot win, but you have to.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean obviously keyboards have been following you for a long time, and I even heard rumors that you are working on a book around that. Started writing back in 2016, if not mistaken. And it’s not just the book, from what I could tell. It’s almost an epic monumental opus about keyboards in three volumes, beautiful slip case, 1,300 photographs, 42 chapters, 520 full color photos, 37 Easter eggs, and four photos of keyboards using Comic Sans. Well, that must have taken quite some time. And you probably are a little bit... Maybe you wouldn’t mean that. A little bit obsessed with keyboards. So maybe you could tell us a bit more about how this all came to be and what should we be expecting in the book?</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, so it started, like I mentioned earlier, I was at Medium and I think Medium offices, they used to have rooms named after typewriters. Just because it’s a publishing company, it’s kind of a cute gimmick. But they also had typewriters in those rooms as decoration. And I didn’t care as much about keyboards before, but I started looking at those typewriters and they all had QWERTY, but they had interesting keys on the periphery and they all were a little bit different. And I started being curious about why. And you mentioned this sort of obsession. What was really interesting about keyboards for me is that the more I kept reading about them, the more there was. There’s this sort of fractal for anything, let’s say backspace. I start looking into backspace. It’s like, "Oh my God." It’s a whole set of stories just around this one key.</p>
<p>Marcin: And I learned over the years that not everything’s as interesting, but a lot more things are more interesting than you think, in general. I think you get into this little... You develop this sense of, "Is this world digging deeper?" And it felt like this. And so I started writing some Medium posts, and then people had really nice reactions to them. I think I wrote one about the Turkish typewriter just because I somehow learned about it. And I got messages from people in Turkey saying, "Thank you. Nobody appreciates this thing that we have." And then I wrote something else about I think typography and typewriters, because that’s increasingly connected. And at some point I had this moment where I’m like, "Wait, if I keep doing that, there’s just enough words for a book." There was almost a numerical approach. I multiplied, I was like, "Oh, it’s a book length."</p>
<p>Marcin: And of course the joke’s on me, because it ended up being much more than I expected. Took a lot more time. But I was talking to Craig Mod, who’s a really good author and just this wonderful creative person. And I think at some point he told me, "If you want to write a book, I think you have to pick a subject that comes back to you even if you don’t want it, because you will need a lot of energy. You will need a lot of help. You will need something that will carry you when you are in the darkest moment. And there will be dark moments." And I thought, "Oh, the keyboard thing keeps coming back to me." I keep looking at it, I keep researching it, I keep writing about it. And that ended up being very, very helpful.</p>
<p>Marcin: I think the rest of it is just like, yeah, I sort of approach it in this sort of semi obsessive way as I do, which maybe will one day lead to my demise or some sort, because this is a lot of stuff. But it ended up being this... You mentioned epic, and maybe it is, but I also very deliberately want to make it not... How do I say it. Nerdy in all the right ways, or intimidating, but in a good way that makes you want to read it. Because it’s a lot of stuff, but it’s also I think written, I hope, in a very approachable way. So you can just get lost in some stories of various keys or typewriters or modern mechanical keyboards. I can pick one chapter, you can read it front to back, but also there’s one thing I’m proud of.</p>
<p>Marcin: I think you mentioned 1300 photos. I think most of them are full color, and it’s also just... You can just look at the book. It’s actually funny. I learned this somehow also through giving talks at Smashing conference, other conferences, of how you tell stories that are textual and visual at the same time. There’s all the schools about what do you put in your slides, don’t read over slide, do this, don’t do that. And I think a lot of them are, do whatever works for you, honestly.</p>
<p>Marcin: I saw people read from slides and I was engrossed. I saw people that have no slides at all, and it was great. So you find your way. But I think the way I found was just this rich tapestry of visuals, sometimes showing exactly what I’m talking about, sometimes showing something that’s parallel, but I don’t even acknowledge it. And I think it’s actually the book in many ways was inspired by Hawaii and other people give talks. Where you have your left brain engage with this, your right brain engage with this, and I hope it actually kind of counterintuitively helps you read the book more. By adding photos it becomes less hard to go through, because there’s always something to carry you. Those photos are also very deliberately chosen, not just so they’re pretty, but they also partake in telling the story.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And so did you design the book then as well? Because it’s a really beautiful design too.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, I did. There’s another part of the journey, and I think the explanation of why it took so long is that I originally thought I’m going to have it published, like many others do. And I actually thought, I don’t want to self-publish it because honestly, I thought that’s just for losers. It’s like for people who cannot get a contract or cannot get an agent. And I kind of went 180 over the first few years where I talked to many people and they said, "Self-publishing is actually really interesting, in a way that you can make this book feel exactly like what you want." And there’s no shame in that anymore. I mean, there are bad self-published books, but there are also bad published. The whole thing became much more flatter and much more actually complicated. Kickstarter made it possible for people to just make the book how they wanted. I decided to do it that way. To do it on my own, and Kickstarter actually coming soon in February. So if that works out, I think it’s going to be-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, it looks a sense of beautiful. I mean, the moment I saw it, I had to swipe through all the pictures and zoom in and zoom out to see everything. So it’s really beautiful.</p>
<p>Marcin: Thank you.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I’m very, very excited to see it coming to fruition. That’s great. Well, actually, because in that research, working and working on that book and looking at all these keyboards, I really have to ask at this point, what was actually the most remarkable typewriter or keyboard? I think maybe keyboard would be more appropriate, that you have discovered. Like the most unusual thing that you have seen.</p>
<p>Marcin: So yeah, it’s a lot, right? It’s really hard to choose this. I actually am in the process of making this book. I amassed this collection of probably 150 strange keyboards in there. The emphasis being strange, because there’s a lot of strange stuff, and I love that. And a lot of it is in the book, photographed. But I think I’m actually going to go the other way, which is, so if you look at the history of keyboards, I nominated five keyboards as being the important keyboards. Sort of like the milestones. The first one is the first QWERTY typewriter. Then there’s the Underwood No. 5, which is the first hit. First typewriter hit. Sort of like the iPhone of its day. Then there’s this electric, which is a beautiful kind of electric typewriter with a font ball and just reinvention of the typewriter. Then there’s the Model M, no surprise here. The clicky keyboard from mid-eighties.</p>
<p>Marcin: And then there’s the iPhone. I think the iPhone just changed so much how we think about keyboards. And so these five keyboards have centerfold in the book, they’re treated very, very well. But I added one more, just personally. I added one more to that list, just something that really excited me. Selectric, which was this electric typewriter came out in, I think 1961, very early sixties. And they kept improving it. And in 1973, I think, they released correcting Selectric II. Which was like v3 of this Selectric. And I actually rented it, because I was interested in it. And it’s really interesting, because it’s still a typewriter. You plug it to the wall, there’s no electronics there at all, and yet it does... First of all, it feels amazing. There were people saying, "Oh, Selectric was the best typewriter or the best keyboard I ever typed on." And I was just like, "Whatever." You just happened to be a teenager at the time, and you just learned to love it, because we all love everything that happened when we were teenagers, right?</p>
<p>Vitaly: We also associate kind of our feelings, whatever we experienced at the time with the device, although it might be just a device.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, it’s classic, right? I’m not going to deny it. And then blah, whatever, nostalgia. And then I talked to him, I was like, "Oh my God, this is actually a really nice feeling typewriter, right? It’s a typewriter keyboard that feels like a computer keyboard. Which is kind of remarkable, even making that happen. But it also has a lot of these things that you would think only computers could have. So it has a little buffer when you press two keys. It remembers the second one, so you can overlap your strokes. It has obviously the font ball where it can replace fonts easily and type. And it has a bunch of other things including, and this is what blew my mind, it has a functioning backspace. If you make a mistake, you can erase it from paper, which seems like something that shouldn’t be possible, because how do you erase it from paper, right?</p>
<p>Marcin: It’s on paper. You can cover it up. No, they actually did this really complicated. It was chemistry. They made this very complicated. It’s not even ink, I think film where it sticks to paper sort of not very eagerly, so you can remove it. And it had this whole little special backspace key. That’s why it’s called correcting Selectric, that if you do it quickly enough, you can remove it. And it’s pretty much gone from paper, especially if you type over it. It’s obviously a dead end. Soon after that, computers took over and keyboards went in a very different way. And with computers, you don’t have to worry about the backspace. It’s almost the opposite. Everything disappears if you’re not paying attention. So backspace is almost the easiest key to make. But this correcting Selectric tool was just... My mouth was open the whole time I was using those. Like, "How is this possible?"</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, that is very exciting. I never thought about this being even possible or ever implemented. That’s unusual. Now, do you think that for your work you could be imagining actually typing on that kind of typewriter and then it’s kind of in some way plugged into your computer? Or will it be just a misuse of technology?</p>
<p>Marcin: No, no. That’s actually another beauty of the Selectric is that the way it was built internally, and if you open... It’s an incredibly complex device, right? It’s so dense. Basically back in the day, the maintenance of IBM Selectric typewriters was a career. They were both so popular and so complicated compared to regular typewriters that you could literally spend your entire life fixing them if you wanted, and many people did.</p>
<p>Marcin: But one of the other things that I didn’t even mention is that Selectric inside, because of how the keys have to be connected to the ball that rotates. By the way, if anybody’s listening, look up Selectric ball, slow motion on YouTube, and it’s just like that alone is a marvel of technology. But the way they connect it, it’s actually through binary code. So people realized very quickly they could repurpose this typewriter to be a terminal.</p>
<p>Marcin: Like back when display screens were incredibly expensive, a lot of people used Selectrics to interface with their computers, because you could type, you can read, it’s a command line effectively. And then even IBM realized this, and they released what they called Selectric IO, which was just a little bit more prepared computer terminal. So on top of everything that I said, it also became this interface. It’s sort of like missing link, not only typewriter keyboards to mechanical keyboards, but also just sort of between typewriters and computers in a way. It’s sort of an event diagram of the universe, Selectric served both sides. I always loved those sort of transitional products, right?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, that’s incredible. But I mean, I think you have very strong opinions also about the butterfly keyboard. Then we had on Mac for a while, the issues we had there. And I do have to ask, I really have to ask. So what kind of keyboard do you use for work? It can’t be a regular one, can it?</p>
<p>Marcin: Well, okay, I’m looking at it now. So obviously I care about keyboards, but I’m not nearly as obsessed as a lot of people about mechanical keyboards. People who put keyboards together, lube their switches. I’ve never went that far, but some of those people are in the book. Some of the stories. I have, let me see. And I think the way I talk about it can tell you what’s important to me. So I have a HEXgears Gemini. Which I had to look up, because I actually forgot. But it’s a TKL. So it doesn’t have a numpad, because I don’t use it. It’s a relatively modern keyboard. It has lights, but I don’t use those lights. What’s important to me is that I have this blank kick ups. Just, I don’t know, it makes me feel cool.</p>
<p>Marcin: But also in the shape of old terminal kick ups from the seventies. I think it’s called SA or SAP, for those who know the jargon. And that was important to me because it’s sort of partly what I learned in my research for the book. And I just like the shape, and it sort of feels, again, like a little bit from the past, little bit from the future kind of situation.
I don’t know what switch... People are going to cancel me for this. I don’t remember what the switches are, but they’re custom switch. Well, not common, they’re not Cherry, they’re something, they’re yellow. I can tell you that. Maybe some of the listeners can chime in. I got them because they’re quieter. They’re linear and they’re quieter for Zoom, but I also like the way they feel. So it was partly functional and partly necessity.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, Marcin, this is way more specific of an answer than I was expecting, but that’s okay. But one thing that you haven’t answered yet, and that’s something I do have to ask as well, is you must have tried at work keyboard or keyboard layout. Or maybe by any chance you have a Turkish F keyboard, I don’t know, or any of the... I don’t even know how to pronounce them. JCUKEN and autopsy or anything of that kind, or are you just using a regular QWERTY one?</p>
<p>Marcin: So again, this might be disappointing for people. I just use QWERTY. I actually don’t touch type very well. Here’s the fun thing. I touch type better with my left hand than with my right hand. I just watched myself, I recorded myself, because I was curious. It just happened. I just happened to learn that way. And that’s kind of like a story of QWERTY. I have a Dvorak typewriter somewhere. I have a Turkish typewriter. I definitely type on a bunch of those layouts as research. Because it’s interesting, and it’s interesting to watch your fingers do all of these different motions. But I think the reason why I use QWERTY, is I think the reason a lot of people use QWERTY, which is it’s just kind of good enough.</p>
<p>Marcin: I was lucky that I never had any issues with my wrists or forearms or what some people call RSI, even though it’s not a proper term. And so I never needed to type a lot. I never needed to type very, very fast. And so I just stopped at some point learning, and I just typed the way I type. And I think that’s true for many people.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Marcin: QWERTY may be disappointing to many people, because we sort of standardized on a really bad thing. But I would argue it’s not that bad, in a way. It was definitely intentional, that we know. It is universal, which we cannot... We have to respect that. The fact that I can use this QWERTY keyboard and type in Chinese or Japanese or many other layouts, even if you switch it to AZERTY or Turkish. It’s just the same physical layout. I think there’s something that actually help us to some extent. And if you care about Dvorak and it’s useful for you, or many of those more modern layouts, or if you have to, because your hands protest at QWERTY, like you can. That’s the beauty of the kind of computer keyboards from the eighties and onward, that you can switch it. You no longer have to... Dvorak had to put it in a typewriter and sell it, and it was just a huge endeavor. Dvorak the person. August Dvorak.</p>
<p>Marcin: And that was hard at that point, in the thirties. Try to convince the typewriter manufacturers to launch a whole new line of typewriters with your thing, even though you said you have scientific proof that it’s better. And I don’t think that’s actually true, but today everybody... And people do come up with their own layouts. I admire a lot of that. But I also think, for example, the kind of market failure of QWERTY has nothing... Sorry, of Dvorak. QWERTY didn’t fail at all. QWERTY keeps-</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think QWERTY is, from what I can tell, from what I’ve heard recently, it’s quite successful.</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah, I mean, that’s kind of like the funny thing. You can grab the guy who puts together the first QWERTY, right? Christopher Latham Sholes. Almost exactly 150 years ago, they released the first typewriter with QWERTY, and you could put him in front of the modern computer and he would know what to do. It’s the same thing. It’s kind of like, you could see it as very disappointing, but it’s also kind of an interesting success story.</p>
<p>Marcin: But I think the failure of Dvorak, or at least the mass adoption of Dvorak and other layouts has really nothing to do with the layout itself. People like Dvorak didn’t really maybe want to care about, which is marketing or storytelling or thinking about transitions. Again, something like with Figma, how do you transition from one keyboard shortcut to the other one? It’s a huge endeavor, and it takes years. So imagine that 50 years after QWERTY was invented. That was already very, very hard. And I think those are the things that also matter, and not just the sort of scientific advantage that’s proved by math of a certain layout, which by the way, is also really, really hard to do, and I don’t think we know how to do that.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. That’s right. Well, as we are wrapping up here, I do have to ask one important question, of course. Now, today we’ve been learning a little bit about keyboards, and we’ll now know that even Marcin is using QWERTY, which is I think perfectly cool and all. But I’ve been wondering also, what have you been learning about lately, Marcin? What keeps you awake at night? Are there any particular topics where you are diving in, or maybe there is one particular keyboard that you’re dreaming about seeing or typing on one day? Do you have this magical thing that you desperately want to see or touch one day?</p>
<p>Marcin: That’s a great question. So to answer in order, I’m learning a lot of things still for the book. I was learning 3JS for the website. I’m learning a lot about printing and marketing now. Not sure that’s super interesting. The one thing that was hard about writing the book, and I think maybe every historian has that, is that there are the artifacts, right? I actually typed on the first QWERTY typewriter for a very brief moment, and it was really cool. It was kind of magical, particularly that it was just in a museum, and nobody told me it was that, I just realized it was that. It was a great discovery. I wish I had a time machine to talk about some of those people and their decisions. People who made the first typewriter, people who made the Underwood No. 5, people who worked on the Selectric, because it feels like there are no blog posts, there are no talks as much. There are some papers, not very many. There are some patterns, but they’re not very useful.</p>
<p>Marcin: I just want some of those people on Twitter talking about their process. I know that’s not going to happen, and I think part of my book is trying to pretend this could happen, tell their stories for them. But I really wish I could just chat over drinks or something with some of those people. And if you want to tell me something that’s completely... It turns out writing a book is just all consuming. It’s just takes over your life, whether you want it or not. So for those who are considering it, I would recommend it, but beware. But I’ve been really inspired. There’s this person on YouTube called Adam Neely, who I think is a professional musician, and it’s just a very different world. Obviously keyboards and music, yes. But I don’t look at it this.</p>
<p>Marcin: He’s this really good storyteller around this... It’s kind of what I think I would want to be for my domain, which is go nerdy on things in approachable ways, and tell those stories about like, why do musicians need in ear monitors, which I’d never really thought about. And it’s a lot about propagation sound and delays and exactly the kind of stuff you think of as a designer. Or what’s the difference between C Sharp and B. Which apparently there is, or just pop culture stuff. So it’s Adam Neely, it’s really, really well done. He’s a great storyteller. And I don’t know much about music, but I’m surprised how often... It’s like watching a TV show. Sometimes it goes over my head, but it’s like always.... You’re watching a pro tell a really good story, and it’s always entertaining.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, that’s very cool. I would love to look that up. Because I didn’t know why artists actually bother to plug in something into the ear. They probably have a pretty good sound quality anyway. But now I know.
Well, if you, dear listener would like to hear more from Marcin, you can find him on Twitter where he’s @ M W I C H A R Y, which is mwichary. Also on his homepage, Aresluna. I do have to ask you, Marcin, at this point, Aresluna, I couldn’t find the connection anywhere between you and Aresluna. What is the connection? Where is the missing link here?</p>
<p>Marcin: Oh, yeah. So it’s actually all connected to the things we talked about. How do I tell this story quickly? My favorite writer of all time is Stanisław Lem, the Polish writer who did a lot of sci-fi. And I think just inspired me to write myself, and inspired me to think of language in much more sort of creative and malleable and fun ways, because he had so much fun with language. And part of that was, so I’m reading this book and there’s this one... It’s a future sci-fi kind of thing. And one ship talks to the other ship, and they say, "Titan for Aresluna reporting to the star base or something." And it’s not explain what it means. It’s just the word Aresluna. And so what Lem was doing was... Turned out to be word building. He didn’t explain something, but if you look at those words, it’s like Ares is Mars, Luna is Moon.</p>
<p>Marcin: So you can very quickly get, oh, they’re flying between the Mars and Moon so often that they just have shortcut, they have jargon for that. So in this one world, you can just establish this big part of story building. So I just kind of like that. I like the sound of it. And I also like that Mars is not like Moon at all. He also wrote about that, and it’s fun. I don’t know, it was just this fun juxtaposition and... I don’t know, it felt kind of important to me to acknowledge that. And if you haven’t read science of Lem, he’s amazing. You should do that.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. Well, fortunately you don’t have to go to Mars or to Moon in order to read about Marcin, and also read his upcoming book. You can also find all the fine details, obviously on Aresluna, which is aresluna.org. We’re also going to link to it in the notes, and you can also be notified about the book updates. And it is really, really beautiful and really incredible and highly recommended, and the title is unbelievable, shifthappens.site. Which I think is a really, really cool name for a book about keyboards. Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Marcin. Do you have any parting words of wisdom for people who are going to listen to us maybe 20 years from now, wondering why were they talking about keyboards? "We don’t even have keyboards anymore. We just speak to computers now."</p>
<p>Marcin: Oh yeah, we’ll have keyboards. There’ll still be QWERTY around.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So are you sure we’re going to have keyboards?</p>
<p>Marcin: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: QWERTY keyboards? So will it be like, I don’t know, touch slash, trackpad slash, whatever keyboard?</p>
<p>Marcin: No, there will be more stuff, of course. There will be voice, there will be maybe some neural connections. But I think keyboards will be with us for a while, because they’re just really good at what they do. For better or worse, QWERTY will be with us for the same amount of time, I’m pretty sure.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So in other words, you’re saying that your book is probably going to stay up to date for the next 150 years.</p>
<p>Marcin: Hopefully as maybe historical artifact, maybe not. Yeah, it’s funny, I just realized that we never mentioned the title of the book, which is a marketing faux pas. Shift Happens. Yeah, buy my book or do it on Kickstarter. But I’m joking. I mean, you don’t have to. I would appreciate it. I think it’s a fun book. I don’t want to pitch it too hard, but think the "parting words of wisdom," is this whole thing happened because I just looked at the everyday object that I thought is boring, and I found it wasn’t boring.</p>
<p>Marcin: It really was not boring at all. So I guess I’m curious for everybody who’s listening, are there other things in your life that are worth looking deeper into, and checking out, and sort of poking at and seeing what happens? Because I think the journey of the book, we didn’t even talk about how many really interesting people I got to learn from and to interview and to talk about. And people for whom keyboards mean so much more than they ever did or will for me. And so I think that will be my suggestion, if you go deep in something and see where it takes you.</p>

<p>From a broad perspective, web accessibility and its importance are understood. Most people will say it’s important to create a product that can be used by a wide array of people with an even wider range of needs and capabilities. However, that is most likely where the conversation ends. Building an accessible product requires commitment from every role at every step of the process. Time, priorities, and education for all involved, so often get in the way.</p>
<p>Performing an accessibility audit can cost a lot of time and money. The results can cost even more with just design, development, and QA (Quality Assurance). An audit becomes even more expensive when considering the other heavy investment. For every role, the learning curve for accessibility can be steep.</p>
<p>There’s so much nuance and technical depth when learning about web accessibility. It’s easy to feel lost in the trees. Instead, this article will take a look at the forest as a whole and demonstrate three keys for approaching accessibility naturally.</p>
The POUR Principles of Web Accessibility
<p>It may sound too simple, but we can break web accessibility down into four core principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. These principles, known as POUR, are the perfect starting point for learning how to approach accessibility.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/keys-accessibility-mindset/pour-principles-accessibility.jpeg" /></p>
<h3>Perceivable</h3>
<p>What does it mean for content to be perceivable?</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re experiencing this article by reading it. That would mean the content is perceivable to people who are sighted. Perhaps, you’re listening to it. That would mean the content is perceivable by people who engage with content audibly.</p>
<p>The more perceivable your content is, the more ways people can engage with it.</p>
<p>Common examples of perceivable content would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images with alternative descriptive text,</li>
<li>Videos with captions and/or subtitles,</li>
<li>Indicating a state with more than just color.</li>
</ul>
<p>A terrific real-world example of perceivable content is a crosswalk. When it is not safe to cross the street, there is a red icon of a standing figure and a slow, repeating beep. Then, once the streetlights change and people can cross safely, the icon changes to a green figure walking, and the beeping speeds up. The crosswalk communicates with understandable icons, colors, and sound to create a comprehensive and safe experience.</p>
<h3>Operable</h3>
<p>Operable content determines whether a person can use a product or navigate a website.</p>
<p>It is common for the person developing a product to create one that works for themselves. If that person uses a mouse and clicks around the website, that’s often the first, and sometimes the only, experience they develop. However, the ways for operating a website extend far beyond a traditional mouse and keyboard. </p>
<p>Some important requirements for operable content are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All functionality available by mouse must be available by the keyboard.</li>
<li>Visible and consistent keyboard focus for all interactive elements.</li>
<li>Pages have clear titles and descriptive, sequential headings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understandable</h3>
<p>What good is creating content if the people consuming it can not understand it?</p>
<p>Understandable content is more than defining acronyms and terms. A product must be <strong>consistent and empathetic in both its design and content</strong>.</p>
<p>Ways to create an understandable experience would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining content language(s) to allow assistive technologies to interpret correctly.</li>
<li>Navigations that are repeated across pages are in the same location.</li>
<li>Error messages are descriptive and, when possible, actionable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Jenni Nadler’s article, “<a href="https://wix-ux.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons-write-better-error-messages-46c5223e1a2f">When Life Gives You Lemons, Write Better Error Messages</a>”, she describes her team’s approach to error messaging at <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. With clear language and an empathetic tone, they’ve created a standard in understandable messaging.</p>
<h3>Robust</h3>
<p>In a way, many of us are already familiar with creating robust content.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had to use a compiler like Babel to transpile JavaScript for greater support, you’ve created more robust content. Now, JavaScript is just one piece of the front end, and that same broad, reliable approach should be applied to writing semantic HTML.</p>
<p>Ways to create robust markup include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validating the rendered HTML to ensure devices can reliably interpret it.</li>
<li>Using markup to assign names and roles to non-native elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The POUR principles of web accessibility lay a broad (if a bit abstract) foundation. Yet, it can still feel like a lot to consider when facing roadmaps with other priorities. This depth of information and considerations can be enough to turn some people away.</p>
<p>Web accessibility is not all or nothing.</p>
<p>Even small improvements can have a big impact on the accessibility of a product. In the same way software development has moved away from the waterfall approach, we can look at web accessibility with the same <strong>incremental mindset</strong>.</p>
<p>Even so, sometimes it’s easier to learn more about something you already know than to learn about something anew. At least, that’s what this entire article relies upon.</p>
<p>With slight adjustments to how we approach the design and development of a product, we can create one that more closely aligns with the POUR principles of accessibility but in a way that feels natural and intuitive to what we already know.</p>
Keys To An Accessibility Mindset
<p>There’s a lot to learn about web accessibility. While the POUR principles make the process more approachable, it can still feel like a lot. Instead, by applying these keys to our approach, we can dramatically improve the accessibility of a product and reduce the risk of exhaustive refactors in the future.</p>
<h3>Markup Must Communicate As Clearly As The Design</h3>
<p>When working from a design, it’s common to build what we see. However, visual design is only one part of creating <em>perceivable</em> content.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/keys-accessibility-mindset/example-navigation-design.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Let’s consider the navigation of a website. When a person is on a specific page, we highlight the corresponding link in the navigation with a different background color. Visually, this makes the link stand out. But what about other methods of perception?</p>
<p>The content becomes more perceivable when its <strong>markup communicates as clearly as its design</strong>.</p>
<p>When dealing with the navigation, what exactly are we communicating with the contrasting styles? We’re trying to say, “this is the page you’re on right now.” While this works visually, let’s look at how our markup can communicate just as clearly.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a aria-current="page" href="/products"&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By setting <code>aria-current="page"</code> on the anchor of the current page, we communicate with markup the same information as the design. This makes the content perceivable to assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>
<p>In this demo, we’ll hear the difference perceivable markup can make.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/keys-accessibility-mindset/example-navigation-design.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Even though navigation items often look like buttons, we understand that they function as links or anchors instead. This is the perfect example of marking up an element based on its function and not its appearance.</p>
<p>When using an anchor tag, we receive several expected functional benefits by default. The anchor will support keyboard focus. Hovering or focusing on an anchor will reveal the URL to preview. Lastly, whether with a keyboard shortcut or through the context (right-click) menu, a link can be opened in a new window or tab.</p>
<p>If we marked up a navigation item like it appeared, as a <code>button</code>, we would lose the last two expected behaviors of anchor tags. When we break the expectations of an element, accessibility will suffer the most.</p>
<p>The following demo highlights the functional differences when using the <code>a</code>, <code>button</code>, and <code>div</code> elements as a link. By navigating the demo with our keyboard, we can see the differences between each variation.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/keys-accessibility-mindset/flight-details-color-only-indicator.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Without first looking at the altitude and ground speed values, I couldn’t tell which system was active. Maybe the imperial option was active since it was the same color as the data. But maybe the metric option was active because it was a different color.</p>
<p>While it may take us a moment to figure out which option is active, it’s an unnecessary one caused by indicating a state with only color.</p>
<p>In the following mockup, we underline the active option and increase its font weight. With these details, it’s now easier to understand the active state of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/keys-accessibility-mindset/flight-details-extra-layer-indication.jpeg" /></p>
<p>So much of creating perceivable content comes down to <strong>communicating in layers</strong>. When we write perceivable markup, we’re creating an extra layer of information. Designing is no different. If we indicate a state with only color, that’s one layer. When we add an underline and font weight, we add additional layers of communication.</p>
<p>People learn and experience in different ways. Consider a book that has an audio version and a movie adaptation. Some people will read the book. Others will listen to it. Others still will watch the movie. When we communicate in layers, more people benefit.</p>
Review
<p>Most people will agree that web accessibility is important. But they will also agree that it can be difficult. With so many combinations of hardware and software and so many nuances with each, accessibility can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>It’s easy to become lost in the weeds of code samples and articles trying to help. One article may suggest an approach, while a second article suggests another. If we’re not able to test each scenario ourselves, it can often feel like guessing. Guessing can be disheartening, even discouraging. It can turn people away from accessibility.</p>
<p>Instead, we can have a dramatic impact on the accessibility of our work by not focusing on specific details but by adjusting how we approach a design from the start. One of the most challenging areas of accessibility is knowing <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> it’s needed. With the keys to an <strong>accessibility mindset</strong>, we can identify those areas and understand what they need. We may not know how to provide a perceivable or operable experience, but it’s easier to find the answer when you understand the question.</p>
<p>I should note, though, that applying these keys will not ensure your work is accessible. Will it make a positive impact? Yes. But <strong>accessibility extends far beyond design and development</strong>. For as long as a product is changing, a <strong>commitment to accessibility must remain at every step and in every role</strong>, from leadership on down.</p>
<p>Ensuring markup communicates as clearly as its design will help provide perceivable content. Writing functional markup instead of visual will help make that content operable. If the functional markup cannot be styled, then return to the first key, and make it perceivable.</p>
<p>Remember, creating an accessible experience for some doesn’t take away from others.</p>
<p>If we think back to the crosswalk example, who are some people who benefit from their design? Of course, those who are blind, even partially, can benefit. But what about a person looking down at their phone? The audible cue can grab their attention to let them know when it’s safe to cross. I’ve benefited from crosswalks in this way. How about a parent using the lights to teach their child how to cross? Everybody can benefit from the accessible design of a crosswalk. Of course, if a person wants to cross when they feel comfortable, regardless of the state of the crosswalk, they can. The accessible design does not prevent that experience. It enables that experience for others.</p>
<p>Accessible design is good design, and it all starts with our mindset.</p>

Those who use them want to show more content within a limited space. At the same time, they aim to present the most important messages as prominently as possible. However, if design and development do not receive proper attention, you will be at the highest risk of creating usability and accessibility issues.</p>
<p>This particularly affects people with cognitive, motor, or visual impairments, for whom using the complex design pattern is usually even more challenging. Whether you call it an "eye candy" or "devil’s spawn", if you want to implement the carousel in a user-friendly and accessible way, a whole range of requirements is to be considered.</p>
“Should I Use A Carousel?”
<p>As widely used as they are, carousel widgets have a bad reputation among UX professionals. They are ignored by users (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>), only 1% interact with a carousel at all, and 89% of them only with the first slide (<a href="https://erikrunyon.com/2013/07/carousel-interaction-stats/">Eric Runyon</a>). Jared Smith even responds to the question <a href="https://shouldiuseacarousel.com">"Should I use A Carousel?"</a> by saying, "Seriously, you really shouldn't." Others state that there isn’t one answer. You have to consider <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/carousel-usage-exploration-on-mobile-e-commerce-websites/#considerations">various factors</a>, such as function, design, platform (desktop or mobile) and, most importantly, context. For whatever reason you include a carousel on a website, make sure it is user-friendly and accessible.</p>
Accessible Implementation
<p>For a carousel to be accessible, it is essential that all users can perceive the widget and its components and that they can easily navigate it using a mouse, touch gestures, a keyboard, a screen reader, and any other assistive technology. The rotation of the slides must not interfere with users' ability to operate the carousel or use the website as a whole.</p>
<p>The W3C’s WAI-ARIA working group provides guidance on implementing an accessible carousel in its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)</a>. This article is based on those recommendations and wants to create a profound understanding of elements and ARIA attributes applied and their impact on users. </p>
<h3>Auto-Rotating</h3>
<p>I assume we have all been there at some point: Constantly changing content can be rather annoying. For some people, however, uncontrolled rotation can be absolutely critical: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People need different times to read content.</strong><br />If the available time is not enough, auto-advancing carousels can become very frustrating. It’s not very satisfying to just be able to skim the text before new content appears without any request.</li>
<li><strong>Some people, especially people with cognitive impairments such as attention deficit disorder, may experience moving content distracting.</strong><br />The movement could prevent users from concentrating and interacting with the rest of the website. People within the autistic spectrum may even have to leave such a page entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Screen reader users may not be aware of the rotation.</strong><br />They might read a heading on "slide 1" and execute the keyboard command for "read next item." Instead of hearing the next element on "slide 1", the screen reader announces a text from "slide 2" — without the person knowing that the element just read out is from an entirely new context. </li>
</ul>
<p>WCAG 2.1, therefore, requires the possibility to stop movement (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pause-stop-hide">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add a "Pause" or "Stop" button if you cannot give up auto-rotation at all.</strong><br />The "Pause" button is the minimum solution (if the movement does not end automatically after 5 seconds).
In addition, usability experts recommend the following: </li>
<li><strong>Pause auto-rotation as long as a slide is being hovered.</strong><br />There is usually a correlation between the mouse position and the user’s interest in a piece of content. Don’t risk a slide change a few milliseconds before a person activates a link and then ends up on the wrong page and, to make things worse, not realizing that this was not the intended one.</li>
<li><strong>Stop the rotation permanently when users are setting focus on interactive elements using a keyboard or interacting with the carousel.</strong><br />An action such as actively changing slides also indicates that the user might be interested in the content. People may temporarily explore other parts of the page but possibly want to come back. Furthermore, you make keyboard navigation easier if the carousel stops as soon as a control receives focus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>For all of us, user interface elements are intuitively easier to use if we can perceive them well. For people with visual impairments, however, this aspect is crucial. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure sufficient contrast.</strong><br />Most often, icons are used to indicate the controls: simple arrows for advancing the slides as well as the widely used dots for selectively fading in. However, these icons often have poor contrast against the background, especially when placed on images. The easiest way to avoid contrast issues is to position the icons outside the slides.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a visible focus indicator.</strong><br />People navigating with a keyboard need to be able to see which interactive element they are currently focusing on. Often design merely (if at all) provides a slight and barely discernible change in color of the controls. If color is the only way to indicate focus, both colors (the one used for non-focused and focused state) must meet at least a contrast ratio of 3.0:1 with each other. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">This minimum contrast requirement</a> also applies to the icon against its background and to other kinds of focus indicators (e.g., a border that indicates the focus state of a button). </li>
<li><strong>The size of the controls affects their visibility as well.</strong><br />Besides, with a reasonable target size combined with sufficient distance between interactive elements, you reduce the risk of accidentally activating a nearby button or a linked slide. This not only benefits people with limited dexterity but also minimizes errors when using mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Indicate the current position within the set of slides.</strong><br />It is not the only option, but often this is done by highlighting one of several progress dots. To ensure that people with color deficiencies can access visual information, you must not rely on color alone but use a color-independent indicator, for example, a filled and unfilled dot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Activation With A Simple Pointer Input</h3>
<p>Many people are used to moving slides on touch devices by swiping. But there are also users who cannot perform this gesture because of their impairment or because of the assistive technology they use. In addition to swiping, enable users with an alternative way of navigating <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-gestures">(WCAG 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures)</a>.</p>
<p>Provide interaction with a simple pointer input (e.g., simple click or tap). That means if there are no slide picker controls to display content directly, you need to implement "Previous" and "Next" buttons.</p>
<h3>Structure, Semantics And Labelling</h3>
<p>The carousel widget is designed primarily for two-dimensional, visual use. For screen reader users who do not see the carousel as a whole, it is much harder to understand the composition of controls and content. These users have different perspectives when <a href="https://techblog.topdesk.com/accessibility/how-screen-reader-users-read-the-web/">using a website</a>. They explore content linearly, tab through interactive elements, and use shortcuts for navigation. The challenge is to provide a meaningful structure and semantics and inform users about controls and slides in a way that enables them to build a mental model of the widget. Use semantic markup for different sections, controls, and content and proper labeling to ensure good orientation.</p>
<h4>Regions And Groups</h4>
<p>Using the HTML element <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2021/07/16/section.html"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a> (or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#region"><code>role="region"</code></a>) with an <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/what-is-an-accessible-name/">accessible name</a>, you can set a generic landmark and thus mark smaller regions of a page. <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html">Landmarks</a> provide a way to identify the structure of a web page to screen reader users and help them with orientation. Using a screen reader, you can display these sections in a table of contents and use specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/landmarks/at.html">keyboard shortcuts for landmarks</a> to move focus to the corresponding content.</p>
<p>When navigating to the landmark, the assistive technology announces the name and type of the section, for example: "[name] — region". In browse mode (exploring content with arrow keys), the screen reader tells users when they enter or exit a region. They will hear something like "[name] — region" or "out of region". (This output in browse mode is currently well-supported by the screen reader NVDA, but unfortunately, with JAWS, users have to set <a href="https://webaim.org/discussion/mail_message?id=47461">screen reader settings</a> accordingly.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#group"><code>role="group"</code></a> is intended to form a logical set of items as a group. Since it is not a landmark, the group is not included in a landmark listing displayed by the user. For that reason, use this role in contrast to <code>role="region"</code> for less important sections of a page. You could use <code>role="group"</code>, for example, to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/#associating-related-controls-with-wai-aria">group (custom) form controls</a> (compare <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> in HTML) but it is not limited to this.</p>
<p>With <code>role="group"</code>, it is also necessary to use the role with an accessible name. The screen reader will convey the boundaries of the group by announcing something like "[name] — grouping" or "out of grouping," and the assistive technology will inform users about the start and end of the group (in this case also JAWS in the default setting).</p>
<p>The following applies to <code>role="region"</code> and <code>role="group"</code>: When the first interactive element within the region or group receives focus, the screen reader will announce its name and role, plus the role and label of the focused control.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-building-accessible-carousels/accessible-carousel%28en%29.svg" /></p>
<h4>The Carousel Container</h4>
<p>Currently, there is no specific HTML element or ARIA role to mark up a carousel. However, you can still convey semantic information to make the existence of the carousel, its sections, and the meaning of the controls clear and understandable to non-visual users. That will help them better adapt to the widget and its interaction patterns.</p>
<h5>role="region|group" + accessible name</h5>
<p>An easy way to make non-visual users aware of the carousel is to use a landmark or a group role: To get there, use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element (or <code>role="region"</code>) or <code>role="group"</code> for the container that encompasses all the carousel elements (including the carousel controls and slides). In addition, provide an accessible name that identifies the carousel as such. </p>
<p>Carousel container marked with a landmark:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div role="region" aria-label="Carousel"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Slides and controls --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Screen reader output when encountering the widget: „Carousel — region“ </p>
<p>The W3C Authoring Practices go beyond this basic markup and recommend using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-roledescription"><code>aria-roledescription</code></a> attribute:</p>
<h5>role="region|group" + aria-roledescription + accessible name</h5>
<p>With <code>aria-roledescription</code>, you create an even more specific output for screen reader users. You thus define the meaning of the container more precisely.</p>
<p>Code sample (HTML): Carousel container marked with a landmark with a specified meaning</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>&lt;div role="region" aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Design patterns"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Slides and controls --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Screen reader output: "Design patterns — carousel" instead of (without using <code>aria-roledescription</code>) "Design patterns — region." In the previous example, we have seen a more generic accessible name ("Carousel"). With <code>role="region",</code> this has resulted in the output: "Carousel — region".</p>
<p><code>aria-roledescription</code> changes the way a screen reader announces the role of an element. This allows authors to define a localized and human-readable description for a role. The screen reader announces the value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> (a string provided by the author) instead of the original role. It overrides the role to which the attribute is applied. <code>aria-roledescription</code> should only be used on elements that have a valid implicit or explicit (ARIA) role. </p>
<p>Back to our carousel, this means instead of region or grouping (you can also use <code>role="group"</code> instead of <code>role="region"</code>), the value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> is read out by the assistive technology. Note: If the <code>aria-roledescription</code> property is set to "carousel", you should not set the <code>aria-label</code> property to "carousel" because this would be redundant.  </p>
<p>The ARIA specification recommends the attribute mainly for clarifying the purpose of non-interactive container roles such as <code>group</code> or <code>region</code>. Otherwise, use it with great caution:</p>
<blockquote>“Do not use <code>aria-roledescription</code> to change the way a role is announced, if it will prevent the user from knowing what to do with it.”<br /><br />— <a href="https://tink.uk/using-the-aria-roledescription-attribute/">Léonie Watson</a></blockquote>

<h4>The Slide Container</h4>
<p>Just as you communicate the boundaries of the carousel as a whole, you can do the same for the slides. Each slide represents simply a smaller entity within the "carousel" composite.</p>
<h5>role="group" + aria-roledescription + accessible name</h5>
<p>Container for slides marked as "group" with a specified meaning:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>&lt;div role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-labelledby="carousel_item-1_heading"&gt;
  &lt;h2 id="carousel_item-1_heading"&gt;Modal dialogs&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;!-- Some more content --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Screen reader output: „Slide — heading level 2 — Modal dialogs“</p>
<p>In this example, the heading of the slide serves as the accessible name of the group. The <code>aria-labelledby</code> property is set to the <code>id</code> of the heading. You could also use the <code>aria-label</code> attribute to convey the position within the set of slides, for example, "1 of 3". In particular, that makes sense if no unique name is available to identify the slide.</p>
<p>Again, if you set <code>aria-roledescription</code> to "slide", the <code>aria-label</code> property should not be set to "slide" to avoid redundancy.</p>
<h4>The Slides</h4>
<p>Slides that are not visible should be hidden, not only visually but from all users (including users of assistive technology). You can either use CSS (<code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code>) or the HTML <code>hidden</code> attribute.</p>
<p>If you truly hide the slides that are not visible, you should not use list markup for the whole set of slides. Screen readers do announce the number of list items (which may seem helpful) but will ignore hidden ones. Concerning the carousel, list markup would not result in an output of the total number of list items but just the visible ones. If only one slide is visible, that wouldn’t be very helpful.</p>
<h4>The Container For The Controls</h4>
<p>What about the container for the controls? It also encompasses a set of items. Because of this, it is reasonable to apply <code>role="group"</code> to it. And again, the group needs an appropriate group name.</p>
<h5>role="group" + accessible name</h5>
<p>Container for controls marked as "group" with a specified meaning:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div role="group" aria-label="Slide controls"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Slide controls --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Screen reader output: „Slide controls — grouping“</p>
<p>In this context, the accessible name (the group name) reflects the purpose of the controls, for example, "Slide controls" or "Choose a slide".</p>
<p>The ARIA Authoring Practices refer to this implementation as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#grouped-carousel-elements">"grouped carousel"</a>.  Another approach is described as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#tabbed-carousel-elements">"tabbed carousel"</a>. Following the "tabbed" pattern, you would use <code>role="tablist"</code>, <code>role="tab"</code> for the controls and  <code>role="tabpanel"</code> (instead of <code>role="group"</code>) for the slide container. Don’t use <code>aria-roledescription</code> in this case. The appropriate ARIA properties are specified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties-22">tab pattern</a>.</p>
<h4>The Controls</h4>
<p>Slide picker controls allow users to display a specific slide. They visually present the total number of slides and indicate the current position within the set. It is rather popular to use "dots" for that purpose.</p>
<h5>Operable Keyboard Controls</h5>
<p>All controls must be operable with the keyboard. Use the native <code>button</code> element for controls of the grouped carousel. That involves the "Previous" and "Next" buttons, the "Pause" button, and the slide picker controls.</p>
<p>If you cannot use native HTML, add semantic information by applying an explicit ARIA role (<code>role="button"</code>) to the clickable <code>div</code> or <code>span</code> element. Use <code>tabindex="0"</code> to include the element in the tab sequence. Furthermore, you need to incorporate JavaScript that provides interactions expected for a button (activation with <code>Space</code> and <code>Enter</code> ). Be aware that ARIA roles do not cause browsers to provide keyboard behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Grouped controls</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;div role="group" aria-label="Slide controls"&gt;
  &lt;button aria-label="Show slide 1 of 4"&gt; 
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;!-- Some more controls --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Screen reader output: „Slide controls — grouping — Show slide 1 of 4 — button“</p>
<h5>The Accessible Name Of The Controls</h5>
<p>Choose an appropriate accessible name (text alternative) in context with the group name. Regarding the above example, the screen reader would announce: "Slide controls — grouping — Show slide 1 of 4" — button" when focusing on the first control in the group (or "Slide controls — grouping — Pause — button" if the first control is a "Pause" button). </p>
<p>Assuming the group name is "Choose a slide," then the heading of the corresponding slide would also be a reasonable label for the button in this context. Instead of using the <code>aria-label</code> attribute, you could also specify the label using <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html">visually hidden text</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the group name and the slide picker elements, the "Previous," "Next," and "Pause" buttons need an accessible name. That means do not forget about the text alternatives for these icons either.</p>
<h5>Semantic Markup Of The Active Control</h5>
<p>Do not just indicate visually but also semantically which control does represent the currently displayed slide. You can use <code>aria-disabled="true"</code> for this purpose. In this case, <code>aria-disabled</code> is preferable to the HTML attribute <code>disabled</code>. Unlike <code>disabled</code>, a button with an <code>aria-disabled</code> attribute is still included in the tab sequence of the page. You may also use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-current"><code>aria-current</code></a> property set to <code>"true"</code>.</p>
<h3>Focus Order</h3>
<p>For a webpage to be accessible using a keyboard or assistive technology, it is important to ensure a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html">proper focus order</a>. That is the order in which you tab through interactive elements. An appropriate order generally means that it follows the visual flow of the page. Users can navigate in a logical and predictable way without loss of orientation. </p>
<p>By default, the tab order is set by order of the elements in the source code (more precisely, in the DOM). That means that the order in which you write the HTML will affect the focus order when navigating with the keyboard. The DOM order also affects the reading order, that is, the order in which screen reader users in browse mode linearly explore content using the arrow keys (non-interactive content included). </p>
<p>The DOM and, with it, the focus sequence should match as closely as possible to the visual order of the page. In this way, sighted keyboard users can easily follow the sequence.</p>
<p>Content changes that precede the current focus cause issues with sequential navigation since screen reader users will not know about such changes (apart from dynamically displayed status messages implemented using <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/02/05/are-we-live.html">live regions</a>). Users need to navigate backwards to reach those interactive elements, which makes navigation more difficult.</p>
<h4>A Proper And Understandable Focus Order For A Carousel</h4>
<p>Many carousel implementations are intended to visually display the controls below the slides: </p>
<ol>
<li>Previous</li>
<li><strong>Slide</strong></li>
<li>Next</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li><strong>Slide Controls</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If this order matches the order of the elements in the DOM, both the activation of "Next" and the activation of the slide controls will cause a content change (display of a new slide) before the triggering control. That is, users need to navigate backwards if they want to explore the content of the slide with the screen reader or follow a link on the slide.</p>
<h5>DOM Order</h5>
<p>The focus order is easier to use, and the reading order is more meaningful if the controls (at least the "Pause" button and the slide controls) are positioned in the DOM <strong>before the changing slides</strong>. If you still want the controls to be visually positioned below the carousel, use CSS for this purpose. When in doubt, a good focus and reading order for the carousel is more important than the optimal conformity with the visual order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pause</li>
<li><strong>Slide controls</strong></li>
<li>Previous</li>
<li><strong>Slide</strong></li>
<li>Next</li>
</ol>
<p>or </p>
<ol>
<li>Pause</li>
<li><strong>Slide controls</strong></li>
<li>Previous</li>
<li>Next</li>
<li><strong>Slide</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that people working with magnification software will locate the "Pause" button more quickly if it is also visually positioned at the beginning of the carousel. They do not see the carousel as one (depending on the magnification level) but might explore the content by moving the keyboard focus or the mouse pointer, which results in repositioning their viewport.</p>
<h5>Pause And Previous/Next Buttons</h5>
<p>When activating the Pause / Play and Previous / Next control, the focus has to remain on the button. That allows sighted keyboard users to repeatedly press the button and perceive the changing content at the same time.</p>
<h5>The Keyboard Navigation For "Tabbed Carousels"</h5>
<p>If you prefer following the "tabbed carousel" pattern, allow users to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/#keyboard-interaction-21">navigate with arrow keys within the set of controls</a>. In addition, ARIA markup must correspond to the tab pattern (unlike the "grouped carousel") to make screen reader users understand the expected operation based on the information announced by the screen reader. </p>
<h5>Working Example</h5>
<p>Complete carousel widget:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>&lt;div role="region" aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Tips &amp; Techniques"&gt;
  &lt;div role="group" aria-label="Slide controls"&gt;
    &lt;button aria-label="Stop auto-rotation"&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button aria-disabled="true"&gt;
      &lt;span class="hide-element"&gt;Show slide 1 of 3: Hiding Accessibly&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button aria-disabled="false"&gt;
      &lt;span class="hide-element"&gt;Show slide 2 von 3: Accessible Contrasts&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button aria-disabled="false"&gt;
      &lt;span class="hide-element"&gt;Show slide 3 von 3: Semantics, WAI-ARIA and Assistive Technologies&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button aria-label="Previous slide"&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button aria-label="Next slide"&gt;
      &lt;!-- SVG icon --&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div role="group" aria-roledescription="Slide" aria-labelledby="carousel-item-1__heading" id="carousel-item-1"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="carousel-item-1__heading"&gt;Hiding accessibly&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- Further slide contents --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div hidden role="group" aria-roledescription="Slide" aria-labelledby="carousel-item-2__heading" id="carousel-item-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="carousel-item-2__heading"&gt;Accessible Contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- Further slide contents --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div hidden role="group" aria-roledescription="Slide" aria-labelledby="carousel-item-3__heading" id="carousel-item-3"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="carousel-item-3__heading"&gt;Semantics, WAI-ARIA and Assistive Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- Further slide contents --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

Wrapping Up
<ol>
<li>Add a button to pause or stop all movement.</li>
<li>Ensure that controls have sufficient contrast (meet WCAG’s color contrast requirements).</li>
<li>Provide a visible focus indicator.</li>
<li>Don’t rely solely on swiping. In addition, provide interaction with a simple pointer input (e.g., simple click or tap).</li>
<li>Provide semantic markup and labeling to ensure that screen readers can identify the carousel as a whole, the slides, and the set of controls. For the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#grouped-carousel-elements">"grouped carousel"</a>, use <code>role="group"</code> with an <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute. For the carousel container, you can also use a landmark (<code>role="region"</code> with an accessible name) instead of <code>role="group"</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>aria-roledescription</code> attribute allows you to specify the meaning of the container tagged with <code>role="region"</code> or <code>role="group"</code>.</li>
<li>If you go for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#tabbed-carousel-elements">"tabbed carousel"</a>, use the ARIA attributes specified in the tab pattern. Ensure keyboard navigation within the set of "tabs" can be operated with the arrow keys.</li>
<li>All controls must be keyboard operable and require meaningful text alternatives for icons.</li>
<li>Ensure a proper focus order. It is recommended to position at least "Pause" and slide controls in the DOM before the slides, even if this order may differ slightly from the visual tab order.</li>
</ol>
Conclusion
<p>This article describes one way of implementing carousel widgets in an accessible way. Even W3C working groups provide different approaches in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/">W3C Accessibility Tutorial</a> (see also a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wai-tutorials/issues/594">discussion on GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://dev.to/ickers/comment/1hbid">comment by Jason Web</a> regarding user testing of "tabbed carousels" and focus management). The important thing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be familiar with semantic markup options and their impact on users.</li>
<li>The objective is to provide a predictable and understandable way of operating the widget, also for non-visual users.</li>
<li>Test with a keyboard and a screen reader. This will show most clearly whether you have met your goal or not.</li>
<li>If you do not have the resources to implement a carousel in an accessible way or if it is just the wrong pattern, better explore <a href="https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/5-alternatives-using-carousel-on-homepage/">alternatives</a>, and you might notice the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/ten-requirements-for-making-home-page-carousels-work-for-end-users/#an-alternative-to-carousels">benefits</a> they entail.</li>

<p>I love HTML. As an old-school front-end developer, I think it’s a hugely underrated skill. I’ve been writing HTML since ~2005, and today the browser alone can almost do all the things Flash could do nearly two decades ago!</p>
<p>One such <em>trick</em> HTML now has is called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animateMotion"><code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code></a> — those familiar with Flash will remember this as <em>The Motion Guide</em>. I found this video from 14 years ago, but the method existed for a while before that:</p>
<p> The idea is, you create a path for elements to follow… and that’s it! </p>
<p>Here’s an example of what you can do with <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code>:</p>

          &lt;g id="track-lines"&gt;
            &lt;path fill="none" stroke="#facc15" d="M167.88,111.3..." /&gt;
          &lt;/g&gt;

          &lt;g id="pink-car"&gt;
            &lt;animateMotion dur="4s" repeatCount="indefinite" rotate="auto" path="M167.88,111.3..." /&gt;
            &lt;path fill="#EC4899" d="M13.71,18.65c0.25-0.5..." /&gt;
          &lt;/g&gt;
        &lt;/g&gt;
      &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first thing to look at is the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element with the <code>id</code> of <code>track-lines</code>. This is the yellow dashed line that represents the path the car will follow.</p>
<p>You’ll also see another <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element with the <code>id</code> of <code>pink-car</code>. Within this group is the <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element. It has an attribute of <code>path</code>. The numbers used to form this path are the same as the numbers that form the <code>track-lines</code>. An <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element is invisible, and its only purpose is to provide a path for an element to follow.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, below the <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element is another <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element, this is the pink car, and it will follow the path of its nearest neighbor.</p>
<code>animateMotion</code> Attributes
<p>There’s some additional attributes that the <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element accepts; these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dur</code>: The duration of the animation.</li>
<li><code>repeatCount</code>: The number of times the animation should loop.</li>
<li><code>rotate</code>: This can be considered as an orientation to the path. It will ensure the element that’s animating around the path always faces the direction of travel.</li>
<li><code>path</code>: As explained, this is the actual path an element will follow.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animateMotion#example">MDN Docs</a> show the <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element as a child of an Svg <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> shape e.g:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;circle r="5" fill="red"&gt;
  &lt;animateMotion
    dur="10s"
    repeatCount="indefinite"
    path="M20,50 C20,-50 180,150 180,50 C180-50 20,150 20,50 z" /&gt;
&lt;/circle&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst this approach works for shapes, it will only work if the element can accept a child. The SVG path element can’t, so wrapping everything in the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element allows HTML to work out where the coordinate system should start and which elements should follow the path. Sneaky ay!</p>
<p>And that’s it. I designed the track and the other elements seen on the <a href="https://animate-motion-race-cars.vercel.app/">preview link</a> in Adobe Illustrator and exported the whole thing as an SVG. I then did a little bit of manual refactoring to ensure the cars were adjacent to an <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element. Et voilà! A race track!</p>
Accessibility
<p>One small snag, the <code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code> element doesn’t natively observe <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion">prefers-reduce-motion</a>. To work around this in the preview I've added a <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/animate-motion-race-cars/blob/main/index.html#L17">media query</a> that sets any element with the class name of <code>car</code> to <code>display: none;</code>. Not ideal, but it is at least motion safe!</p>
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this post, and if you have any questions, please come and find me on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon">@PaulieScanlon</a>, oh and if you’re a better illustrator than I am, please, feel free to re-design the race track and cars, and I’ll be happy to convert it into code!  </p>
<p>See you around the internet!</p>

While I consider storytelling as an art, it is also a discipline that has its roots in Ancient Greece and Aristotle’s writing: <em>Poetics</em>:</p>
<blockquote>“A whole [story] is what has a beginning and middle and end.”</blockquote>

<p>In this essay, the Greek philosopher identified for the first time the three main components of a story: beginning, middle, and end, and how they each related to one another.</p>
<blockquote>“A beginning is that which is not itself necessarily after anything else, and which has naturally something else after it. An end is that which is naturally after something itself, either as its necessary or usual consequent and with nothing else after it. And a middle, that which is by nature after one thing and also has another after it.”</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/01-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Artistotle3ActStructure.png" /></p>
<p>Aristotle’s three-act structure has remained unchanged since 300 BC. Although many writers, screenwriters, and film directors have conducted a variety of complex experiments, the most <strong>successful stories never stray from this basic root</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, designers use the same structure to map user experiences and design user-centered products. A remarkable and memorable example of the power of storytelling is the change in Apple’s direction of communication on Steve Jobs’ return. He had spent some time running Pixar, and his experience with the company’s storytellers was essential to what happened next at Apple: the belief that by <strong>focusing on customers’ needs</strong> and tapping into their stories, they would sell more computers. (They did, of course!)</p>
<p>However, designers cannot become good storytellers by using Aristotle’s three-act structure alone. We must also identify specific storytelling elements to help develop our narrative.</p>
<p>In the following five steps, we will tap into each of the different elements of storytelling, with a running example of the approach I used to <strong>design the experience and interface</strong> behind the <a href="https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/"> video course landing page</a>.</p>
<a href="https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7cc4e1de-6921-474e-a3fb-db4789fc13dd/b4024b60-e627-177d-8bff-28441f810462.jpeg" /></a>Meet <a href="https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/">Smart Interface Design Patterns</a>, our new video course on interface design &amp; UX.

Step 1: Understand Your Protagonist And The Purpose Of The Product
<p>As designers of experiences, we need to build beautiful interfaces that create meaningful interactions with our audience. So before imagining the layout of the landing page, I needed to find an answer to a critical question: <strong>who is our protagonist?</strong></p>
<p>The <em>protagonist</em> is the hero of our story. The story, therefore, is never about the product we sell. It is always about the protagonist, who reflects the audience’s own interaction with that product.</p>
<p>So to answer the first question, we need to know our <strong>protagonist’s needs, goals, fears, and frustrations</strong>. This is the rule number one for every UX designer, just as it is for any storyteller.</p>
<p>When you need insights about your protagonist, you can use a <em>set of questions</em> to conjure a most likely persona. If the product already exists in the market, you can use other research tools, like usability testing or heat maps. In my case, <em>Vitaly Friedman</em>, the creator of the video course, had already identified his target ahead of time, during the workshops and conferences he had completed in the past year.</p>
<p>Watching the video chapters of the course, I understood that our story’s protagonists would be <strong>UX and UI designers</strong> with a beginner to advanced level of knowledge about design and interface design patterns.</p>
<p>The frustration of these protagonists is usually the lack of time to research and learn. Specifically, those who are trying to fully embrace the world of UX design wish to learn design patterns quickly, so they can figure out the reasons why one might offer a better experience than another. On the other hand, a more experienced target group doesn’t have time to stay updated with the latest UX best practices between projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/02-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Personas.png" /></p>
<p>Our protagonists’ needs and story, therefore, define our <strong>story’s purpose:</strong> Why does this story matter to them?</p>
<p>Defining the <em>why</em> of the story is always a challenging step of storytelling. It only becomes easy once you know your protagonist well. The audience will only stick around if the story resonates with them. Additionally, a story without a clear purpose is hazy and irrelevant, so the story’s intention must be defined upfront.</p>
<p>Re-articulating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMOlfsR7SMQ">Simon Sinek’s Golden Circle</a>, a <em>stickable</em> story needs to know the purpose of its existence, i.e. the audience problem it is trying to solve (<em>why</em>), what sets it apart from others (<em>how</em>), and at the end, the product and service it is selling to solve the problem (<em>what</em>).</p>
<p>This is what the Golden Circle looks like when applied to the experience design for the landing page:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/03-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-GoldenCircle.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>why</strong> of our story tapped into our protagonists’ frustrations about the <strong>lack of time</strong>. So our story is first about communicating that learning is an investment. Secondly, through Vitaly’s own experience and research, they will save time and effort.</li>
<li>The <strong>how</strong> reflects on their learning goals and staying up to date: if they are hungry for knowledge, they will be satisfied.</li>
<li>The <strong>what</strong> is a reflection on the WHY and HOW. We want people to <strong>subscribe to the video course</strong> only after evaluating its benefits and tasting the material (adding some valuable features during navigation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSP5oR9g-ss">free samples</a>, previews, extra gifts, and persuasive elements, like testimonials).</li>
</ul>
<p>The protagonist and the purpose are the elements that propel us to the next step of our narrative: <strong>the plot.</strong></p>
Step 2: Define The Structure Of Your Narrative
<p>Aristotle teaches us that stories must be a chain of cause-and-effect moments. Each scene must lead to what happens next and not work as a standalone <em>episode</em>, no matter how attractive and well-executed it is. Remember, the plot must also have <strong>a beginning, middle, and end.</strong> </p>
<p>In his book, <a href="https://buildingastorybrand.com/">Building a Story Brand</a>, Donald Miller examines the cause-and-effect structure as follows: a <em>protagonist</em> aims for something, but in her quest, she encounters a <em>problem</em>. During her journey, a <em>guide</em> steps into her life and shows her a <em>plan</em> that invites her to action. By <em>acting</em>, the protagonist will <em>avoid failure</em> and end her story in a <em>success</em>. He calls this structure the <strong>StoryBrand Structure.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/04-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-StoryBrand.png" /></p>
<p>For every project, whether a digital product or brand design, I combine Miller’s StoryBrand format with Aristotle’s three-act structure to convey <strong>a clear sense of continuity</strong> throughout the narrative. </p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/05-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Artistotle3ActStructure-StoryBrand.png" /></p>
<p>Then I work on each act individually, analyzing every element of the narrative.</p>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>The beginning, also known as the first act, is the <em>setup</em>.</p>
<p>In UX design, this is the moment where we meet our <em>protagonist</em> (the hero) with her problems and goals, as analyzed in the previous step.</p>
<p>At the end of <strong>Act I</strong>, our protagonist meets a <strong>guide</strong>. The guide is not another hero. They simply act as a helping hand, showing the protagonist how to move forward in her transformational journey. You could use the plot of your favorite movie as an example of how this occurs.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from my own favorite childhood movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/">The Neverending Story</a>. The child-protagonist, Bastian, is neglected by his father and bullied at school (<em>problem</em>). Trying to escape the bullies, Bastian enters a bookstore, annoying the bookseller <strong>(the guide)</strong> who is reading an interesting book that is not for children. Secretly, Bastian takes the book, titled <em>The Neverending Story</em>, and reads it in the school’s attic.</p>
<p>The book describes the fantasy world of Fantasia, which is slowly being devoured by a malevolent force called “The Nothing”. The Childlike Empress, who rules Fantasia, has fallen ill, and the young warrior Atreyu is tasked to discover a cure, believing that once the Empress is well, The Nothing will no longer be a threat.  </p>
<p>Bastian soon understands that the book he is reading will save Fantasia from disappearing (<em>the plan</em>), and he needs to give a new name to the princess (<em>Action</em>) to help Atreyu win his battle against The Nothing (<em>avoid failure</em>). Then, he will save the Childlike Empress and her Empire (<em>success</em>).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/06-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-TheNeverEndingStory.png" /></p>
<p>So, when identifying the <em>guide</em> of your story, whether a person, a service, a product, or a brand, ensure it is someone <strong>the audience will trust</strong> and follow because they feel understood and in safe hands. The guide’s inner qualities are <strong>empathy and authority,</strong> which should be reflected in every communication material they share with their audience.</p>
<p>In the landing page example, our story’s guide is Vitaly Friedman. Investigating his profile, I established a past of remarkable work sharing resources and best practices in Smashing Magazine and many conferences, workshops, and online. On social media, Vitaly has built a strong reputation in his community as a UX expert and extremely knowledgeable in this field. He, therefore, possesses all <strong>the traits of a guide.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/07-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-VitalyActivity.png" /></p>
<h3>The Middle</h3>
<p>The middle, also known as <em>the second act</em>, is the <strong>confrontation</strong>. In this specific part of the story, we assist the transformation of the protagonist and her emotional state (this transformation is also known as the <em>character arc</em>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second act, the guide gives the protagonist a <em>plan</em>. The question the protagonist expects the <em>guide</em> to answer is, “What do you want me to do now?”</p>
<p>In the middle of <em>The Neverending Story</em>, we discover that Bastian needs to follow a precise plan: he needs to give a new name to the Childlike Empress to prevent the dissolving of Fantasia.</p>
<p>So the plan needs to be clear, highlighting every step and <strong>removing any sense of risk</strong> or doubt that our protagonist may have in considering it.
By giving your users a plan, you set a clear path to help them move forward in their journey.</p>
<p>In the case of the landing page, I asked Vitaly to list the content of his offer and explain the simple steps that must be taken to subscribe to the available plans. I then underlined the unique values and the plan for each subscription and designed a simple overview.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/08-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Plans.png" /></p>
<p>At the end of the second act, the guide must clearly communicate what <em>action</em> the protagonist needs to perform with the plan.</p>
<p>In <em>The Neverending Story</em>, the protagonist Bastian is in complete disbelief that he is part of the solution, and moved by the Empress begging, he calls out the new name, running to the attic window to call out “Moon Child”. </p>
<p>In the same way, when we sell a service or a product, we need to <strong>invite the users to take a journey with us</strong>, just as we have via the landing page. If we plainly tell them, they will know what to do with our well-laid plan.</p>
<p>Vitaly invites the audience to act in two ways. One is a <strong>direct call to action</strong> through a "Buy"-button that is positioned on different parts of the landing page. The other is a transitional call to action through free video episodes, email newsletter and content samples.</p>
<p>Transitional actions also come in other forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>testimonials</strong> from other experts in the field, and </li>
<li><strong>unlimited access to the UX checklists</strong>, an elegant deck of 165 cards to learn and recall basic design patterns for successful digital experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/09-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Actions.png" /></p>
<h3>The End</h3>
<p>The ending is the story’s third and <strong>final act.</strong></p>
<p>It is here that we will decide how our protagonist will succeed in her goal or avoid failing. In doing so, we need to achieve <strong>the peak of our story or climax</strong> by specifying what’s at stake if the user (or the protagonist) doesn’t engage with us.</p>
<p>It is essential to <strong>find the right balance</strong> in how we introduce negative consequences, so we can avoid generating fear that will parallyze and freeze the protagonist from moving forwards in her journey.</p>
<p>In <em>The Neverending Story</em>, when the Childlike Empress begs Bastian, she tells him that Fantasia will disappear without his help, and so will his favorite hero, Atreyu, and his dragon Falkor. She taps into Bastian’s wishes of belonging to something bigger than himself, thereby proving that he is worthy. This a desire we sense the protagonist seems to aspire to since the beginning of the movie when he seeks his father’s attention or tries to escape his bullies. </p>
<p>For the video course, we remind the user that she can only become an expert after a while and that <strong>it would probably take many years</strong> of research and reading and studying to become good at UX. So why not build the knowledge on top of well-explained, curated foundation and jump into a course with Vitaly, who has “cooked” the best recipes and <strong>bulletproof design patterns</strong> over 15 years?</p>
<p>We should remember that our story’s goal is to <strong>motivate our users</strong> to become better versions of themselves, and that they need only start this journey with us to achieve such an incredible transformation!</p>
<p>For this particular reason, the third act is also called <em>the resolution</em>. When designing a user journey, we also define a list of resolutions to the protagonist’s problem. In designing the user experience for the landing page, the list was created from a mix of status and inspirational resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-improvement:</strong> Become an influential and more knowledgeable UX designer, and receive a UX certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Networking opportunities:</strong> Join an advanced UX workshop where you will meet Vitaly, get feedback from him personally and work with other designers around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Improve the web:</strong> Work confidently towards designing better digital experiences on the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resolutions were presented in different parts of the landing page to remind the user why she is on this journey with us, and where we wish to take her.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/10-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-StructureForSIDP.png" /></p>
Step 3: Connect The Plot With A Wireframe
<p>Now that all of the story elements are in place, it is essential to understand how they will fit together and connect on the landing page. I usually think about each page of the website as <strong>a single shot with its beginning, middle, and end</strong> scenes. Many of these shots make a scene, and a series of scenes make an entire website or application.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/11-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-PlotStructure.png" /></p>
<p>Following the plot I created in the previous step, I started out by organizing the content and adding <strong>critical plot points</strong>.</p>
<p>Plot points in dramaturgy are incidents that directly impact <em>what happens next</em> in a story. When used well, they help the protagonist move forward in her journey. In UX, the plot points work <strong>precisely in the same way</strong>. They are <em>actions</em> (for example, “buy now” buttons), <em>barriers</em> (logins or forms to fill), <em>delights</em> (unexpected interactions or free samples), <em>system events</em> (confirmation messages and emails), and <em>triggers</em> (notifications) that the user needs to perform to move forward in their journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/12-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-PlotPoints.png" /></p>
<p>Using a simple piece of <strong>dotted paper</strong>, I usually start sketching how my story’s content will ideally be displayed between the different parts of the page. You may wonder about the mobile-first approach at this point. When designing an experience as we are doing right now, what matters is ensuring it is <strong>consistent with our story</strong> and that it can be replicated on every media, no matter the pixel size or the support used.</p>
<p>So if you wish to start with mobile or a large screen, our aim is to define the user journey in a way that could be transformed into an interface for the landing page (as in our case), in a leaflet, or in a marketing campaign.</p>
<h3>Opening Scene</h3>
<p>The opening scene <strong>sets up the story’s premise</strong> and is the first element of the page that the user will see, regardless of which website or application she lands on. The upper area of the page presents the product or service to the audience.</p>
<p>We wanted to <strong>induce curiosity</strong> in our protagonist in this specific part of the page. For this reason, the content needs to be engaging and compelling, prompting the user to scroll down for more. I would add a trigger that actively invites the user to “scroll down” to the next part of the shot, the middle scene.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/13-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-OpeningScene.png" /></p>
<h3>Middle Scene</h3>
<p>The middle scene of our shot is the place where most of our narrative will happen. We will introduce our protagonist to <strong>the guide, the plan, and the action</strong> we wish them to perform. There will be a section that explains the video course and the content in full detail, with content samples and other elements that will help users better understand and explore the video course.</p>
<p>To build <strong>authority and trust</strong> around our experience, we do not simply introduce Vitaly but also a series of <strong>testimonials from other experts</strong>. Our protagonist is no longer curious but armed with relevant information! She needs a clear reason to engage with our product. For this reason, any action or plot point added should satisfy this specific emotional aim.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/14-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-MiddleScene.png" /></p>
<h3>Closing Scene</h3>
<p>The closing scene is <strong>the resolution of our plot.</strong> </p>
<p>As previously explained, we offer <strong>two plans</strong> that evoke two specific outcomes; we are not simply asking which plans our protagonist wants, but what kind of transformation she is aiming for. Here the user is <strong>mindful</strong>, so we need to ensure nothing distracts her from the decision-making.</p>
<p>So in this specific scene, the “Buy”-button is the one and only action we wish our user to focus on.</p>

<p>The footer and the top navigation are complementary elements of our narrative. The navigation facilitates the journey, while the footer provides more engagement in case our hero needs additional time to decide or wishes to join the larger community that Vitaly is serving.</p>

Step 4: Add Emotional Connection To Create A Memorable Story
<p>The first three steps focused on the user journey and page content. In this step, we think about <strong>making the story memorable for our users.</strong> Otherwise, our landing page will look like any other random page!</p>
<p><strong>Emotional connection</strong> is an essential part of the storytelling process and can be conveyed through visual elements like colors, sounds, illustrations, animations, and images. These play a huge role in motivating and giving intention to the actions taken by the user.</p>
<p>To find the central theme of our landing page, I focused on critical elements and designed a map with keywords to help me create a <em>forced connection</em>, another wonderful aspect of storytelling that is based on combining disparate functions, materials, or processes.</p>
<p>This process is used to generate disruptive ideas and original concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our users’ needs (hungry users)</strong>: learning fast, getting the best lessons in UX, and hungry for knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>The set (kitchen)</strong>: a friendly and informal kitchen.</li>
<li><strong>Vitaly’s role (chef)</strong>: experienced teacher, UX expert and guide.</li>
<li><strong>The tools (recipes)</strong>: real-time examples, blackboard, notes, video courses, and slides.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/16-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-ForcedConnection.png" /></p>
<p>These elements all remind me of <strong>a well-designed food experience</strong> conveniently delivered right to your door: our “knowledge-hungry” users can follow Vitaly’s recipes (<em>the videos</em>) at their own pace. Each <em>recipe</em> has been prepared and cooked by Vitaly, packed with the <em>best nutritional elements</em> (tips, tools, examples. slides, and so on) that create strong and compelling designs.</p>
<p>The <strong>color palette</strong> is a mix of inspiration from the blackboard that opens each episode of the course, the primary red of the Smashing Magazine theme, and the wonderful video course illustrations by <a href="https://guillaumekurkdjian.com">Guillaume Kurkdijan</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/17-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-ColorPalette.png" /></p>
<p>I then used the previous wireframe and <strong>enriched it with sketches</strong> that could complete and clarify the scene. These sketches served as a blueprint for the final illustrations.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/20-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Sketches.png" /></p>
<h3>Opening Scene</h3>
<p>A rich starter to introduce some of the design patterns taught in the course is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSP5oR9g-ss">accordion UX</a> (<em>the spring with fish</em>), reviews and ratings (<em>stars</em>), cookies (<em>the biscuit</em>), hamburger menu (<em>the spaghetti</em>), adding personality to the web (<em>salt and pepper</em>).</p>
<p>The illustration matches the user’s emotional state, <strong>curiosity</strong>, by surprising her with an unexpected food theme.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/18-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-OpeningIllustration.png" /></p>
<h3>Middle Scene</h3>
<p>We decided to introduce Vitaly with images showing him involved in teaching, while the course chapters are like <strong>cookbooks</strong> on the shelf, shown through a carousel.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/19-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-ChapterCarousel.png" /></p>
<p>My favorite illustration is the <strong>Buddha Bowl</strong>, which is used to introduce all the content provided during the course. This illustration satisfies our <strong>protagonist’s need for more information</strong>. It is interactive so that from the ravioli to the small bottle of oil, the audience can explore the nutritional elements that make this course so unique and flavourful!</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/21-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-BuddhaBowl.png" /></p>
<h3>End Scene</h3>
<p>Three small illustrations introduce the <strong>available plans</strong> that tap into the resolutions we mention in step 2. The illustrations for each plan are relevant to the plans but presented small to avoid interfering with the focused state of our protagonist.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/22-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Plans.png" /></p>
<p>An empty bowl suggests that our users have now <em>eaten</em> a part of the content, but if they are still hungry, there are more ways to engage with Vitaly.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/23-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-EmptyBowl.png" /></p>
<p>Additional small illustrations, all food related, introduce the different sections of the landing page and their content. Talented animator, <a href="https://www.cassie.codes">Cassie Evans</a>, brought these illustrations to life with <strong>subtle animations</strong> so that the entire landing page is playful and appealing.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/24-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-SmallIllustrations.png" /></p>
Step 5: Test Our Narrative Before Engaging With Our Customers
<p>Before presenting an idea to customers, I usually follow <strong>a detailed check</strong> to ensure that the final design still represents the user’s story, as outlined during the previous steps.</p>
<p>Some of the questions I ask myself are the following:</p>
<h4>What Primary Action Do I Want The User To Take On This Page?</h4>
<p>The answer references the story element <strong>action.</strong> I usually check if there are enough <em>plot points</em>, like buttons and triggers, on the page to engage the user at different stages of her journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/25-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Question01.png" /></p>
<h4>What Secondary Action Do I Want The User To Take?</h4>
<p>This answer relates to the <em>transitional actions</em>, which means anything that invites the user to engage with us in other ways before they click the “Buy”-button.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/26-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Question02.png" /></p>
<h4>How Am I Supporting The Need To Scroll For More Details?</h4>
<p>In this case, my attention switches to <strong>the plot and the cause-effect element</strong> that define the narrative. Looking at the structure laid out in step 2, I check if the scenes included in the landing page still follow the logic of the user’s journey and if there are enough plot points to carry the narrative.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/27-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Question03.png" /></p>
<h4>Does Any Content Distract The User, Or Prevent Her From Completing Her Task?</h4>
<p>This question focuses on the clarity of the message and our resolutions. In general, each page should focus on a specific outcome. Anything that blurs our intentions should therefore be removed.</p>
<p>Different parts of the landing page refer to our <strong>three resolutions</strong>, with the entire page built around them.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/28-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Question04.png" /></p>
<h4>Can We Anticipate The Final Action?</h4>
<p>The answer to this question usually relies on the user’s ability to <strong>jump into the climax of the story</strong> quickly, to the action (in our case: available plans with “Buy”-buttons). Think about fast-forwarding your favorite movie to get to the most thrilling scene or leafing to the last page of a book to discover who the killer is!</p>
<p>In the case of a landing page, the “Buy”-button is at the beginning of the navigation and follows the user as she scrolls… so she can jump to the story’s third act at any time she likes.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/sell-product-powerful-storytelling/29-SIDP-SellingIdea-Storytelling-Question05.png" /></p>
Conclusion
<p>As we have discovered, storytelling is more than just another business buzzword. Storytelling is <strong>an exciting and strategic approach</strong> with rules and clear principles that, when used well, can help brands stand out from the crowd with a clear message and a user-centric approach. It’s an essential skill that designers should embrace, no matter their specialization or profile.</p>

<p>As such, the different steps I have illustrated will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify your protagonist</strong> and build a powerful, purposeful story that speaks to their frustrations and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Create a user journey</strong> that directly relates to the protagonist’s story.</li>
<li><strong>Structure that journey as a wireframe</strong> to identify your chosen story content based on the narrative structure.</li>
<li><strong>Create an emotional bond with the user</strong> by adding meaningful illustrations.</li>
<li><strong>Check the story’s narrative with questions</strong> that evaluate your use of the wider storytelling process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Precisely as it occurs in the world’s most acclaimed movies, building a solid narrative structure guides you in creating scenes and chapters that are consistent with the user’s own story.  </p>
<p>In this way, you can use the plot of a solid, recognizable, and popular narrative as a base from which to create <strong>additional scenes and chapters</strong>, and even successive sequels — as a great many movie franchises have achieved with thrilling effects.</p>
<p>In fact, the same plot illustrated in this post for the <a href="https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/">landing page</a> helped me to create a warm and instantly recognizable design for Vitaly’s upcoming secretive new project. Still, as the narrative voice of <em>The Neverending Story</em> reminds us, “that is another story, and shall be told another time!” </p>

It’s very likely that in your codebase, there are objects with <code>name</code>, <code>id</code>, or <code>label</code> properties that are used to determine if an object is the one you’re looking for.</p>
<pre><code>if (element.label === "title") {
    make_bold(element);
}
</code></pre>

<p>At a certain point, your project grows (in size, importance, popularity, or all at once). It needs more strings as there are more things to distinguish from each other. The strings grow longer, as does the cost of typos or, say, your label naming convention changes. Now you have to find all the instances of those strings and replace them. Consequently, a commit for that change becomes much bigger than it should be. Which makes you look better in the eyes of the clueless. Simultaneously it makes your life miserable since it’s much harder now to find the cause of regression in your git history.</p>
<p>Strings are bad for identification. You have to consider uniqueness and typos; your editor or IDE won’t check if it’s the string you meant. It’s bad. I hear someone saying, “Just put them in a variable, duh.” That’s a good suggestion, and it removes some of my concerns. But look at John Smith:</p>
<pre><code>const john_smith_a_person = "John Smith";
const john_smith_a_company = "John Smith";

// Do they have the same name?
john_smith_a_person === john_smith_a_company; // true

// Are they the same thing?
john_smith_a_person === john_smith_a_company; // true
</code></pre>

<p>John happens to share the name with a company. What if I say to you I have a better solution? The one that removes all the concerns and adds more value — allows you to achieve more. What would you say? Well, I won’t rewrite the article just because your answer doesn’t fit my narrative. The answer is objects. You use objects themselves to figure out if an object is the one you’re looking for.</p>
<pre><code>// Do they have a same name?
john_smith_a_person.name === john_smith_a_company.name; // true

// Are they the same thing?
john_smith_a_person === john_smith_a_company; // false
</code></pre>

<p>It makes the intent clearer. Let me give you a better example. Say you have labels in your app. They are localized, so the label string is determined by the localization library you’re using and your team’s translation process. You keep your labels in a module where you have them all neatly organized and curated. Once you need to do something special for certain labels, you can compare it directly with the one you’ve got.</p>
<pre><code>import React from "react";
import labels from "./labels.js";

const render_label(label) =&gt; (
    &lt;Label
        className={label === labels.title ? "bold" : "plain"}
        icon={label.icon}
        text={label.text}
    /&gt;
)

function TableOfContents({ items }) {
    return (
        &lt;ul className="my-menu"&gt;
            {items.map(render_label(item.label)}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>See how much more I can do with objects? In the <code>labels</code> module, I’ve set aside a label <code>title</code>, which in this case should be rendered bold. Plus, being an object, my label can hold a localization string (imaginatively called <code>text</code>) and an icon. It’s all neatly organized in advance, which keeps my UI logic clean.</p>
<p>But it’s just a part of the picture. I know we use objects all over the place, and it’s nothing new to group things in them. But I bet you don’t use them exactly like that. I rarely see two objects being compared like that because you never know what’s in there or where it came from. Objects are created and changed all the time. It is more likely for them to be compared by the values of their properties than the objects themselves. And the reason for that is that objects aren’t suitable for that kind of use. They are too capable. To allow that use case and many others, we have to, on the one hand, reduce some capabilities of objects and, on the other, implement some more. And in the end, we’ll get what I call <strong>Primitive Objects</strong>. Th... a solution to al... some problems.</p>
<p>In the first part of the series, I want to cover some aspects of JavaScript that help bring objects closer to primitive values, which in return would allow us to benefit from common language features that aren’t usually associated with an object, like comparisons and arithmetic operators. In the following part, we’ll look closely into practical examples and tools to work with such objects. Now let’s see what objects are like in JavaScript.</p>
Properties Of Primitive Values We Need
<p>First, let’s define our goal. Let’s draw a picture of where we would like to be afterward. What properties of primitive values do we want our objects to have?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutability</strong><br />Primitive values are read-only. We want our objects not to be editable by anybody after their creation. Recall the example before. What use of a label do we have if some code out of our control has changed the text or icon of it? Once the object is defined, it should be set in stone.</li>
<li><strong>Work with operators.</strong><br />Expressions with certain operators return their appropriate type. Arithmetic operators give numbers back. Comparisons give booleans.</li>
<li><strong>Have literal syntax.</strong><br />Literals for primitives give you the exact value, or rather an object representing the value. Such objects get created once for each value. Each time you have <code>"hello"</code> in your code, you get the same object.</li>
<li><strong>Have types.</strong><br />The <code>typeof</code> operator tells you what you’re dealing with (except for <code>null</code>). We don’t always know which kind of object we get. So before we poke its properties, it would be nice to know what we’re dealing with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I listed them by immediate usefulness. And as luck would have it, they are also ordered by easiest to get. In this article, I’ll cover the first one and a part of the second one. We’ll see how to make objects immutable. We also will define their representation in primitive values, which allows us to use some operators on them. Moving from objects to primitive values is easy, as primitive values are objects themselves — sort of.</p>
It’s Objects All the Way Down, Even If It Kinda Isn’t
<p>I remember my confusion when I first saw <code>{} === {}; // false</code>. What is this language that cannot even tell apart two equal things? It felt so ridiculous and amusing. It was much later that I learnt that there are much worse parts in JavaScript, after which I stopped laughing while watching <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">wat talk</a>.</p>
<p>An object is one of the fundamental things in JavaScript. You might have heard that in JavaScript, everything is an object. That’s quite true. Apart from some bottom values, all the primitives are objects. While technically, it is more nuanced, from the perspective of our code, it is true. In fact, it’s true enough that believing everything is an object might be a useful mental model. But let’s first try to understand what is happening with that object-to-object comparison that was so amusing to younger me.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer">Object literal</a> syntax is used for creating new objects. It allows us to declare and initiate an object in a single expression.</p>
<pre><code>// Instead of this.
const my_object = new Object();
my_object.first_property = "First property";
my_object.nth_property = "Next property";

// You can do this.
const my_object = {
    first_property: "First property",
    nth_property: "Next property"
};
</code></pre>

<p>Much cleaner, right? But now I think the lack of object initialization line is what got me confused about those two empty object equality expressions. It seemed to show the language’s struggle to recognize apparent equality. But what actually happens in that expression is this:</p>
<pre><code>new Object() === new Object(); // false
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s obvious they aren’t equal. You’re comparing two distinct objects you’ve just created. To expect contrary is the same as expecting <code>5 === 3</code> to return <code>true</code>. In both cases, they are different things.</p>
<p>Let’s do a sanity check. Would two variables referring to the same object be considered equal?</p>
<pre><code>const my_object = {};
const other_thing = my_object;
my_object === other_thing; // true
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, only the first line has an expression that creates an object. On the second line, we make the <code>other_thing</code> variable refer to a just-created object. Two variables are now referring to the same object. Comparing them is just like comparing two equal numbers, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Why is this significant? Because it gives us a way to check if a variable refers to an object we’re looking for. And if we think about it in the context of “everything is an object,” that’s how numbers and strings work. When you compare two variables holding strings, the engine doesn’t have to check if each character in those strings is the same. It’s enough to compare if the variables refer to the same object. That is thanks to the most significant difference between regular objects and primitive values — immutability.</p>
How To Bring Regular Objects Closer To Primitive Values
<p>In JavaScript, Primitive values are immutable. You cannot change a single character in a string as well as you cannot make a number five to become six. If you use <code>const</code> to initialize a variable and put a primitive value in it, it’ll always stay the same. No one could change the value; it’s immutable. No one could reassign the variable; it was created with <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look closely at how numbers work. You can get six out of five by incrementing it by one, but it doesn’t change anything about five.</p>
<pre><code>const five = 5;
const six = 5 + 1;
five === 5; // true
</code></pre>

<p>Some might say that using <code>let</code> would change that. But look, it cannot change five:</p>
<pre><code>const five = 5;
let result = 5;
result++;
result === 6; // true
five === 5; // true
</code></pre>

<p>A five is still a five. That is because <code>++</code> is just a shorthand for <code>+= 1</code>. See the equals sign? What happened was I <em>assigned</em> a new value to the <code>result</code> variable, the value that I got from the <code>result + 1</code> expression (which is what <code>+= 1</code> is a shorthand for). The <code>const</code> keyword prevents reassignment to a variable. In the example above, that’s what gives me a way to know that <code>five</code> always refers to a <code>5</code> object.</p>
<p>We might assume that the only way primitive values are <em>changed</em> in JavaScript is through the assignment, which means what we’re actually changing is what a variable refers to. So it’s variables that are changing, not values. Not primitive ones, at least. But how it works with objects instead?</p>
<p>After initializing an object, you can change its properties: delete them, add new ones, and reassign old ones. We are all familiar with doing that. But apart from that, it behaves the same as primitive values. In fact, if you get accustomed to a model where objects and primitive values are the same things, you’ll look differently at all sorts of problems in JavaScript.</p>
<p>You probably stumbled upon a question about how variables are passed to a function. People ask whether variables are passed by value or by reference. A common answer is <strong>primitive values are passed by value</strong> while objects are passed by reference. But with the mental model I’m forcing on you here, you might already know what I will say about that. Before that, let me show you how the question doesn’t make much sense in JavaScript. I will also reveal to you a sleight of hand that many articles and tutorials use.</p>
<p>When you pass variables as parameters of a function call, they get assigned to the function’s arguments. Arguments are local variables to a function’s scope and have no connection back to the original variables, which makes sense. If you pass an expression to a function, you have to put the result of it somewhere, don’t you?</p>
<p>Look at the following two functions. They do the same thing, pass a value through, but one is defined with a single parameter, the other with none. The second one demonstrates what is happening with the parameter we passed in.</p>
<pre><code>function single(arg) {
    return arg;
}

function none() {

    // The first parameter is assigned to a variable `arg`.
    // Notice the `let`; it will be significant later.
    let arg = arguments[0];

    return arg;
}

single("hi"); // "hi"
none(5);      // 5
</code></pre>

<p>You see that they both work the same. Keeping in mind how function arguments work, let’s try changing some values. We’ll have a function that changes its only argument and returns it. I also will create some variables that I’ll pass to the function one by one. Try to predict what would be printed in the console. (Answer is in the second sentence of the next paragraph.)</p>
<pre><code>function reassign(arg) {
    arg = "OMG";
}

const unreassignable = "What";
let reassignable = "is";
let non_primitive = { val: "happening" };

reassign(unreassignable);
reassign(reassignable);
reassign(non_primitive);

console.log(unreassignable, reassignable, non_primitive.val, "😱");
</code></pre>

<p>Did your guess has any “OMG” in it? It shouldn’t have, as the console will show “What is happening 😱.” No matter what gets passed to a function in JavaScript, reassigning changes only the argument variable. So, neither <code>const</code> nor <code>let</code> change anything here because the function doesn’t get the variable itself. But what happens if we try changing the properties of an argument?</p>
<p>I created another function that tries to change the <code>val</code> property of its argument. See if you can guess the message in the console this time.</p>
<pre><code>function change_val_prop(arg) {
    try {
        arg.val = "OMG";
    } catch (ignore) {}
}

const a_string = "What";
const a_number = 15;
const non_primitive = { val: "happening" };
const non_primitive_read_only = Object.freeze({ my_string: "here" });

change_val_prop(a_string);

</code></pre>

<p>Is there any “OMG” in your guess now? Great, the message is “undefined undefined OMG undefined 😱.” The only time the function could change the property is with a common object. What does it tell us? Is there any difference between how primitive values are passed and how objects are? Is it that passing frozen object suddenly changes it to pass-by-value? I think it’s more useful to treat them as equals.</p>
<p>Now about that sleight of hand I mentioned. Practically all the resources do that thing where they say that primitives and objects are passed differently, then immediately follow it with an example where they treat them differently. Look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions#description">function description in MDN</a>. By the time of this writing, it described it like this (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>Arguments may be passed by value (in the case of primitive values) or by reference (in the case of objects). This means that if a function <strong>reassigns</strong> a primitive type parameter, the value won’t change outside the function. In the case of an object type parameter, if <strong>its properties are mutated</strong>, the change will impact outside of the function.</blockquote>

<p>I just showed you the reassigning wouldn’t change the object either. You cannot change primitives’ properties because they are read-only, which is also the case for frozen objects. And most of the examples you’ll find do the same thing. They first state the difference between two values, then demonstrate it using different methods for each value.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to criticize, don’t get me wrong. It probably was done because it explains JavaScript quirks in a more familiar way. Just be aware that sometimes an explanation gives you a model of thinking about a problem. But the model is never completely true to the nature of a problem.</p>
<p>Looking at this issue from the perspective of primitives being just like frozen objects helps you to recognize what actually happens. Alternative tutorials become illogical. And now, having discovered this notion of a primitive object that no one could change, let us make them more friendly for the rest of your program.</p>
Converting
<p>Primitive values stand on their own; any program knows how to handle them. Objects could be anything. And even if you call them primitive, it’s not enough for them to suddenly become first-class citizens. To achieve some of that, we need to do some work.</p>
<p>You can define a way to convert objects into primitive values such as strings or numbers. For example, let’s create an object representing a rating from zero to five. We need to be able to work with numeric representation for comparison and sorting. We also need to be able to output it in text.</p>
<p>There are certain methods that you could define to describe your object’s representation. Remember <code>[object Object]</code>? It’s what you get when you try to turn your object into a string:</p>
<pre><code>String({}); // "[object Object]"
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s change that.</p>
<h3>String Representation</h3>
<p>That output comes from the default <code>toString</code> method defined in the Object prototype. But you could overwrite it by defining it on your own object.</p>
<pre><code>String({ toString: () =&gt; "hello there" }); // "hello there"
</code></pre>

<p>That’s what we will use for our rating objects. To make it convenient, let’s create a function that initializes and freezes such objects. It will also check if the value is within the zero to five range and return <code>undefined</code> otherwise.</p>
<pre><code>function new_rating(value) {
    const max = 5;

    // That symbol forces textual representation (who needs emoji anyway 🙄).
    const text_only = "\ufe0e";

    const star = "⭑" + text_only;
    const no_star = "⭐" + text_only;

    if (
        !Number.isSafeInteger(value) ||
        (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; max)
    ) {
        return undefined;
    }

    return Object.freeze({
        value,
        toString: () =&gt; star.repeat(value) + no_star.repeat(max - value)
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s rate something. There is a pen I like. It’s pretty great, and I’d give it five stars.</p>
<pre><code>const ratings = new WeakMap();
ratings.set(jetstream_pen, new_rating(5));
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>WeakMap</code> for ratings is how you could assign properties to objects without actually changing them. Now, whenever we want to have a rating, we can convert both of our objects to strings.</p>
<pre><code>if (ratings.has(jetstream_pen)) {
    console.log(`${jetstream_pen} ${ratings.get(jetstream_pen)}`);
    // "Uni-Ball Jetstream 0.5 ⭑︎⭑︎⭑︎⭑︎⭑︎"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wrapping both objects in string template literal is what I relied on here to trigger the <code>toString</code> method. Otherwise, you could just call the <code>String</code> function on them, as I did at the beginning of this section.</p>
<h3>For Numberphiles</h3>
<p>For numbers, there’s the <code>valueOf</code> method, which is called whenever there’s an attempt to convert to number comparisons or math operators (except for <code>+</code>). Let’s add it to our <code>new_rating</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function new_rating(value) {
    // ...

    return Object.freeze({
        value,
        toValue: () =&gt; value,
        toString: () =&gt; star.repeat(value) + no_star.repeat(max - value)
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it might seem redundant to return the <code>value</code> property directly. But remember that no one but us knows that it’s there. Returning it from <code>toValue</code> is a universal way to get a numeric representation.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have our pen object again. And let’s say the rating is now its property (just to simplify the example). We can now filter out items with less than four stars:</p>
<pre><code>articles.filter((item) =&gt; item.rating &gt; 3);
// [ { name: "Uni-Ball Jetstream 0.5", ... } ]
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we can sort items by rating. We can do that using the Arrays’ <code>sort</code> method. You probably already have your favorite little sorting function that you’d like to use, like this one:</p>
<pre><code>function sorter(first, second) {
    return second.rating - first.rating;
}

const sorted_by_rating = array_of.sort(sorter);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>sorted_by_rating</code> holds an array of the very best items.</p>
Conclusion
<p>I rarely looked at objects as something that could extend what could be expressed in JavaScript. With primitive objects, that’s what I’m trying to explore. There are still things we cannot add, like new operators or literal syntax, but still, with primitive objects, we could define new types of values.</p>
<p>In this first part of the <em>Primitive Objects</em> series, I tried to give an overview of how to make objects resemble some primitives properties. You freeze them to make them read-only. You also can define a representation in primitives, either number or string, to make it work with arithmetic operators or output them in text.</p>
<p>In the next parts coming up next week, I aim to give more examples of usage and comparison with other approaches I’ve encountered. You will see how to make it easier to create primitive objects and turn them into structures.</p>
<p>In this series, I’m trying to touch on <strong>JavaScript features that can be relied on</strong>. Even if not all of it makes sense, I hope that by looking at some of the examples I gave here, you’ll learn something useful that would make working with JavaScript less brittle without unnecessarily turning to additional tools.</p>

<p>There are plenty of services nowadays that work with photos. Retouched images usually fulfill their purposes much better than raw ones. If you develop a service that allows its users to upload photos, wrapping a photo editing tool right in the service prior to uploading could save much time for your end users. Even though there is a large amount of photo editing software, both for desktop and mobile and online, editing a photo or a batch of photos in such software could be slower than editing the photo within your service UI.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a user choosing a photo, applying some changes to it, and simply uploading it. They wouldn’t need to use a complex desktop or mobile software; they wouldn’t need to waste time by uploading the original photo to an online image editing tool first, then having to save the edited image locally, and finally uploading it to your service.</p>
<p>A perfect example of such a use case is an online marketplace for used cars. It would be really hard to sell a car without providing some photos of it, right? You may want to touch up a number of photos before uploading them, e.g. by masking the car plate or adjusting the tones and colors. Another example is a property management platform. Again, photos are vital for selling or renting a property, and retouching may come in handy, as well as adding some text over the photos for explanations and clarifications. Stock photo platforms may also benefit from allowing their end users to customize their purchased stock photos before they download them.</p>
<p>There are many solutions to this problem. When choosing the best one for your website or app, you’d better take the following into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy To Integrate Into Your Product</strong><br />You don’t want to read tons of documentation in order to integrate such a tool.</li>
<li><strong>As Many Various Features As You Like</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong><br />The majority of the end users need easy-to-use tools to edit their photos.</li>
<li><strong>Rich API</strong><br />The more control you have over the photo editor, the better.</li>
<li><strong>White-Label Support</strong><br />You want to make it look like part of your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Output Images</strong><br />Web performance is vital.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable Pricing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the image editors that you may like to consider and try out is <a href="https://pixoeditor.com/?utm_campaign=sm2023&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=smashingmagazine">Pixo</a>. And for full exposure, that’s the one we are currently working on, with a friendly free plan available as well. Pixo can be integrated into any website or app because of its easy integration (just a few JavaScript lines) and rich API. It is also available to WordPress as a plugin, replacing the default image editor in WP Admin. Pixo Editor has all the features of the default editor plus a few more.</p>
<p>One of them is <strong>batch editing</strong> which allows the site administrator/editor to make some changes to a photo and replicate them to the whole batch. Simply select a batch of photos in the Media Library and choose Batch Edit. When Pixo opens the first photo for editing, the site editor makes some changes — chooses a filter, adjusts colors, and adds text. On save, the changes will be replicated to the rest of the photos from the batch!</p>
<p>But something even cooler is the fact that Pixo can be integrated into a WordPress site’s frontend — no matter which theme is chosen or which plugins there are. Pixo attaches to a file input field and listens for image selection; when the end user picks a photo, Pixo Editor opens it for editing. The user can then make some changes and save them back to the file input. Submitting the file input will actually submit the edited photo, not the original one. This basically makes the editor very easy to integrate anywhere.</p>
<p>You can make it attach to every file input field on the page, or a specific one, via CSS selector. The form submission handler can be an online shop plugin or a contact form plugin. Does not really matter as long as it prints a file input field on the page and handles the file upload on form submission. </p>
<p>As Pixo is a SaaS, it can be integrated anywhere with a few lines of JavaScript. It can load an image from the DOM or from a URL, <code>base64</code> string or <code>dataurl</code>, from the local file system, and more. </p>
<div>
 <pre><code>var image = document.getElementById('myimage'); // DOM image
var image = '<a href="https://yourdomain.com/path/to/image.jpg')">https://yourdomain.com/path/to/image.jpg')</a>; // image url
var image = 'abfdSDFEWwq2332Wdsdsdf435esf345SDfdr4S='; // base64 encoded image
var image = 'data:image/png;base64,abfdSDFEWwq2332Wdsdsdf43..'; // dataurl
var image = '{...}'; // previously exported image as JSON

var constructor_options = { apikey: 'abc123xyz000' }; // must be a valid API key issued by <a href="https://pixoeditor.com">https://pixoeditor.com</a>
new Pixo.Bridge(constructor_options).edit(image);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When the edited image is exported, you can decide what to do with it in a callback function. </p>
<div>
 <pre><code>new Pixo.Bridge({
    apikey: 'abc123xyz000',
    onSave: function(image){
       // download the photo
       image.download();
       // or inject it into the DOM
       document.body.appendChild(image.toImage());
       // or serialize it as JSON
       image.toJSON();
       // or upload the photo
       var data = new FormData();
       data.append('image', image.toBlob());
       var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
       request.open('POST', '<a href="http://yourdomain.com/path/to/upload.php')">http://yourdomain.com/path/to/upload.php')</a>;
       request.send(data);
    }
 }).edit('<a href="http://yourdomain.com/path/to/imagetoedit.jpg')">http://yourdomain.com/path/to/imagetoedit.jpg')</a>;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here is a CodeSandbox example showing some of the available input and output options:</p>


Photo Editing Features
<p>Pixo Editor implements the most common image editing tools — crop and rotate, color correction, adding rich text over the image, filters and stickers. There is a stock stickers library, but the end user can upload another image and insert it as a sticker.</p>
<p>One of the greatest features is the Background tool. It allows the end users to replace the background with a solid color, another image from Unsplash, or a custom image.</p>
<p>There are drawing tools that allow the end users to draw freely on top of the image. The Pencil tool is useful for circling some parts of the image or drawing arrows to point to something. The Blur tool is excellent for masking parts of a photo — car plates, faces, or other sensitive information. The Erase tool does what it says — erases parts of inserted stickers and other images. Unfortunately, the Erase tool does not work on the source photo.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is session restoration. When the user edits a photo in Pixo, downloads it, and then opens it for editing, all objects like text and stickers are editable, and the undo/redo history is there too. This is really cool because if the user makes a mistake, s/he can fix it very easily. Session restoration also works if the user closes the web browser by accident. Opening the editor with the same photo will prompt the user to restore the previous session, and his/her work won’t be lost.</p>
<p>Last but not least, output photos get great compression without any quality loss, so you don’t have to worry about traffic and storage. The editor also supports WebP format.</p>
White Label Support
<p>Pixo Editor has full white-label support. You can change the look and feel of the editor completely in order to match your own brand — logo, colors, fonts, and even layout. The API gives the possibility to define your color palette with a few JavaScript properties. But you can even upload a custom CSS file with overrides and change basically anything. The editor comes with six default themes that you can build your own on top of.</p>


Templates
<p>Creating templates is yet another cool feature of the service. With Pixo Editor, you can apply changes to an image and export it as a template. Then, when the end user selects this template, your application code can load it in Pixo Editor, replacing the source image with the one selected by the user. This way, all edits, like text blocks, filters, and color corrections, will be applied to the user’s image at once. This is very useful for poster images.</p>
<p>You can create templates with text placeholders. When the end users edit these templates, they can add their custom text to the placeholders and export the final result as an image.</p>
<p>Here are JSFiddle examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/pixoeditor/1o3d9Lq5/">Template Creator</a><br />An instance of Pixo being used to create a template and save it to localStorage for simplicity.</li>
<li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/pixoeditor/u8jfkx45/">Template Consumer</a><br />An instance of Pixo being used to pick an image and apply the template to it.</li>
</ol>
API
<p>Pixo provides an API that allows developers to configure the editor, as well as to execute commands and apply changes to the currently loaded photo. For example, you can extend the stock stickers library with your custom stickers very easily:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>pixo_instance.filterStickers(function (stock_stickers) {
   // merge or completely replace the stickers
   return my_stickers;
});
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A similar approach can be used if you want to amend the stock photo frames, fonts (for the text tool), and pre-defined crop sizes. And if you want to apply a change to the current photo programmatically, you can do it with the <code>exec</code> command. You can do almost everything the end user can do within the editor — simply by executing the corresponding command. This includes applying a filter, inserting a sticker, removing the background, color correction, cropping, transforming, and more. Combined with some custom CSS, you can quickly implement your own controls and use only the canvas and the business logic from Pixo:</p>


<p>In the example above, we hide the built-in controls with CSS <code>(display: none)</code>, and we leave only the canvas visible. And with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript that calls the <code>exec</code> API, we basically implement our own custom controls. This can be in handy if, for some reason, we cannot fully customize the UI the way we like with just CSS.</p>
<p>But there are many more use cases for the API. For example, we can ensure that the edited images match a specific aspect ratio by cropping the image on load using the API. Or, we can insert a watermark when the editing is done by the end-user, on export:</p>


REST API
<p>Pixo also provides a REST endpoint. You can call it posting an image binary file or with a URL to an image or its base64 representation, and apply the same changes as the end user can do within the editor:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>curl -X POST -F 'apikey=yourapikey' -F 'filter=Sepia' -F <a href="mailto:'image=@input.jpeg">'image=@input.jpeg</a>' <a href="https://pixoeditor.com/api/image">https://pixoeditor.com/api/image</a> &gt; output.jpeg
</code></pre>
</div>

Integrating Pixo Into Native Mobile Applications
<p>Pixo is a JavaScript-based service designed for websites or web applications, but it can also be integrated into native mobile applications thanks to the WebView component, supported by both iOS and Android. The flow is very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>The User picks up a photo for editing using a native Image Picker component;</li>
<li>The photo is encoded to base64 string;</li>
<li>Pixo is loaded inside a WebView component;</li>
<li>The base64 string is sent to Pixo using the WebView messaging API;</li>
<li>The User edits the photo with the editor;</li>
<li>The User is happy with the edited photo and exports it;</li>
<li>Pixo calls back a native function through the WebView API and passes the edited photo as a base64 string;</li>
<li>The base64 string is converted to a native image.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see here <a href="https://gitlab.com/pixo-editor/integrations/ios">a demo app for iOS</a> that implements the above approach and <a href="https://gitlab.com/pixo-editor/integrations/flutter">an app for both iOS and Android implemented in Flutter</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The same approach could be implemented into an Electron desktop app.</p>
Pros And Cons
<p>Using a third-party image editing service is great because of its very easy integration. Adding an image editing SDK or even implementing such an editor on your own requires much more effort. Also, the service "automatically updates", i.e. you will get the latest, greatest and coolest new features, bug fixes and improvements, and new browsers support automatically — without having to change anything on your end. This, however, increases the risk of getting new bugs introduced if the newer version was not properly tested by the vendor.</p>
<p>But since it’s an online service, there is a risk that it could be down for some time, and during this period, your end users won’t be able to do their work. The self-hosted solution will always be up and running as long as your main app or website is live. Still, Pixo’s average uptime is 99.993% (according to the public status report) which is not that bad.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>Pixo seems to be a good image editing solution for all websites and web apps that need to provide image editing as a feature. Its detailed documentation and examples make the integration very easy. Pixo has <a href="https://pixoeditor.com/?utm_campaign=sm2023&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=smashingmagazine">a 30-day full-featured free trial</a>. After that, you can continue using its basic editing tools and APIs for free or get a subscription plan with full features. </p>

What am I meant to do with that?” Our response is usually to empathize with our poor colleague — after all, we’ve all been there before — and laugh at the stupidity of clients. </p>
<p>This sort of interaction can be a great bonding moment with a fellow designer. Still, as an industry that’s meant to be great at <em>empathizing with people</em> we might be missing something here, especially if we find ourselves getting this sort of feedback fairly regularly. Maybe it isn’t all the fault of the stupid colleague or client. Perhaps it’s also got something to do with <strong>how we present our work, the questions we ask, and when we choose to ask them</strong>.</p>
What’s Going Wrong
<p>I’ve sat through more bad design presentations than I care to think about, with designers walking through every single design decision they’ve ever made.</p>
<blockquote>“First, I tried this. Then I tried that. I didn’t like how this worked, so I tried this other thing, and it felt better.”</blockquote>

<p>It’s like sitting through a slide show of somebody else’s baby pictures or holiday snaps or a child coming back from school and talking about the exciting finger painting lesson they just had. Super meaningful to them but pretty dull for everybody else.</p>
<p>So is it any wonder when the rest of the people in the room tend to switch off their critical faculties — after all, no business problems are being shared or important decisions being made — and join the designer on a step-by-step tour of their Figma history, only to be jolted back to the room with the immortal words:</p>
<blockquote>“So what do you think?”</blockquote>

<p>At this point, the executives snap back into action. They’ve been asked what they think, and if there’s one thing executives love doing, it’s giving feedback. So they’ll jump in with a list of things they don’t personally like:</p>
<blockquote>“That looks too big. This looks flat. I don’t like this color. Can you make this area pop a bit more?”</blockquote>

<p>Opinions, opinions, opinions. That is exactly what the designer <em>didn’t</em> want. </p>
<p>So, how do you break this cycle?</p>
Framing The Request For Feedback
<p>Instead of presenting a linear case study that will show every design revision, the first thing you need to do is frame the problem — essentially, to <strong>explain what’s wrong</strong> with the current design and <strong>what problem you are attempting to solve</strong> with the new version. After all, design is meant to be about problem-solving rather than pretty pictures, right?</p>
<p>If you would like to show a few dead ends along the way and ramp up the drama, that’s fine. However, you will need to explain those in terms of the <em>problem being solved</em> rather than saying vague things such as “This typeface didn’t work” or “We needed a better color scheme,” as such things will encourage subjective opinions.</p>
<p>Instead, when you present the final design, engage with the stakeholders on a strategic level and <strong>explain how the new design solves the problem at hand</strong>. Or even better: Explain how you’re going to test/prove how it solves the problem and by how much.</p>
<blockquote>“We’re going to push this release out next week, and we will come back to you with some figures by the end of the month.”</blockquote>

<p>This is much better than a vague, “What do you think?”</p>
Be Specific
<p>If you are genuinely looking for feedback, be specific about what kind of feedback you’re looking for. Are you looking for comments on the visual style, or are those already set through your design system/brand guidelines? Often you’re not really looking for feedback as much as seeking to understand whether they agree that this solution solves the stated problem. So if that’s what you’re looking for, ask them.</p>
<p>If you think there may be contentious issues with the design, flag these up in advance. So, for instance, rather than waiting for the Chief Marketing Officer to ask about the opt-out checkbox, let them know that it’s been changed to opt-in to <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">comply with GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>If you receive feedback, don’t always assume you’re being asked to change something in the design. It’s perfectly reasonable to <strong>receive the feedback as a gift</strong> (free advice) and let people know that you will take into consideration what they said.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether the feedback is a request, don’t hesitate to clarify. If that person isn’t the DRI (directly responsible individual), let them know that you’ll run it past the DRI for final approval. Execs are often just trying to be helpful, so it’s your job to frame the problem and channel their feedback in the correct manner.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to say:</p>
<blockquote>“We’re not looking for feedback on the visual language at the moment, but we would love feedback on X!”</blockquote>

<p>Whatever that X may be, of course.</p>
Don’t Seek External Validation. Ask For (Real) Feedback
<p>Designers often ask for feedback at the end of a presentation when it’s really not necessary. It’s perfectly reasonable to frame a presentation as an update and state something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>“We’re not looking for feedback at this stage.”</blockquote>

<p>Designers desperately want to be appreciated, so the request for feedback at the end of a presentation may be a clumsy attempt to solicit some praise.</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<blockquote>“What do you think?”</blockquote>

<p>When you really mean:</p>
<blockquote>“Please help support my fragile ego and tell me how great I am!”</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, this subconscious need for external validation regularly backfires, and you’re left feeling worse rather than better.</p>
<p>This is a key distinction I see between junior and senior designers. Junior designers often ask for feedback in the hope they are right and will get a pat on the back. By comparison, more senior designers genuinely hope they’ve missed something because they realize <strong>good feedback will help them grow</strong>.</p>
<p>As such, the correct answer to such feedback is:</p>
<blockquote>“That’s super interesting — tell me more!”</blockquote>

<p>That would be much better to say rather than blurting out a list of reasons why the feedback is wrong and you’re right.</p>
Learning From Our Mistakes
<p>As an expert, you can tell people their ideas will not work or are going to backfire until you are blue in the face, and they still won’t listen. Instead, the only way most people learn is to go ahead, experience the failure in a tangible way, and then start their own learning loop.</p>
<p>While you want to avoid the “told you so” conversation, you do need to be visible when that lightbulb goes on so they know that the next time you flag up an issue, they could avoid a lot of pain by listening to what you say. <strong>Usability testing</strong> is a great way to instrument this learning process. </p>
<p>Sadly, designers are very good at flagging up all the reasons why something won’t work and end up feeling frustrated when people don’t listen. However, we’re less good at follow-up. As such, the ultimately responsible person often never sees the problem occur because it’s obscured, not directly experienced, or hidden in the data, and they don’t see you as somebody who could help them avoid similar mistakes in the future. Instead, we get angry with stakeholders who don’t heed our (often) very good advice, which ironically makes them even less likely to listen to us next time.</p>
<p>As a start-up advisor, I regularly see founders make <strong>easy-to-avoid mistakes</strong>. I’ll always flag these up as I think it’s unfair to see people hurt themselves and their businesses unnecessarily. However, you often need to let them make those mistakes in order to learn.</p>
Show Your Work Early And Often
<p>This last problem is a bit of a biggie. I see far too many designers who only want to show work they think is 95% done and then get frustrated and defensive when asked to make changes. You can understand why. It’s like getting to the finish line of a marathon, only to be told that the race has been extended by another ten miles. It’s exhausting and disheartening, and you’re not entirely sure you have enough “gas left in the tank” in order to continue.</p>
<p>This behavior is often tied up in a designer’s psychology and sense of self-worth. We don’t like receiving criticism — I mean, who does? — as it often feels like it’s us who are being criticized rather than the work we did. So we hide away until we’re sure we’ve got it nailed before stepping out into the blinking sunlight, only to have some mean executive crush our dreams. </p>
<p>The answer is annoyingly simple. </p>
<p>Rather than waiting until you’ve reached perfection, get comfortable showing work in progress — messy first drafts you know are going to solicit feedback.</p>
<p>That way, when you get said feedback, you’re not going to be shocked or surprised, and you still have enough energy and will to make the necessary changes. So rather than being precious, good designers show their work early and often! They bring execs along with them on the journey.</p>
<p>Just kill the “big reveal” moment — you don’t need it!</p>
Conclusion
<p>Ultimately feedback is a gift. It allows us to produce better products with a higher chance of being accepted by our clients, partners, and peers. In order to get useful, actionable feedback, designers need to get comfortable showing work early and often; they need to get better at presenting the business case for their work; and they need to get better at asking the right questions and guiding the sort of feedback they want and need.</p>
<p>The best designers know this. Good designers hope to be proved <em>right</em>. However, great designers want to be proved <em>wrong</em>. Why? Because it’s the most effective way to learn and get better.</p>
<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>There are lots of great resources out there on design feedback! Here are a few of my personal favorites, including a few excellent articles from Smashing Magazine.</p>
<ul>
<li>A good place to start would be the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/149190240X/"><em>Discussing Design: Improving Communication and Collaboration through Critique</em></a> by Adam Connor (<a href="https://twitter.com/adamconnor">@adamconnor</a>) and Aaron Irizarry (<a href="https://twitter.com/aaroni">@aaroni</a>).</li>
<li>Also this article on async feedback “<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/asynchronous-design-critique-giving-feedback-part2/">Asynchronous Design Critique: Getting Feedback</a>” by Erin Casali (<a href="https://twitter.com/Folletto">@Folletto</a>) is very good.</li>
<li>As an aside, I’d love to see more designers go into meetings saying something along the lines of “We believe this improvement will drive £ 1 million in additional revenue over the next three years.” rather than “Making this design change is the right thing to do.” which happens more often than not. One of the reasons I love the <a href="https://twitter.com/GrowthDesigners">@GrowthDesigners</a> community (<a href="https://growthdesigners.co">Growth Designers</a>) is that they represent designers who have decided to focus specifically on one or (arguably) more of these areas and can articulate and demonstrate the direct impact they have on the business as a result.</li>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/vpieters"><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/smashing-podcast-episode-56/veerle-pieters-200x200-opt.jpg" /></a> Vitaly Friedman: She’s a graphic and web designer who founded a graphic and web design studio with her wonderful, wonderful partner, Geert. She was born on the Belgian coast near Bruges — oh, I would love to go back to Bruges — and now lives in Deinze, a city in London with 45,000 inhabitants. From an early age, she immersed herself into drawing and love of illustration has kept her going for more than three decades now. And she’s been designing logos, stationary, brochures, books, websites, and applications since then. She has worked with Facebook, Google, Greenpeace, Adobe, the Library of Congress, and so many other small and large companies and organizations. Most importantly, she chooses her project based on how well she connects with the company, all people working there.</p>
<p>Vitaly: She’s also a firm believer in the power of sharing, which is exactly what she has been doing in her wonderful tutorials, articles, and inspiration feed since 2003. Now, when not designing, she loves listening to soulful deep house music and present her bicycle, and there are plenty of photos proving that this is indeed true. So, we know she’s a wonderful designer and illustrator, but did you know that being a Belgian, she, of course, loves Belgian chocolate, but also Swiss typography and Swiss graphic design. My smashing friends, please welcome Veerle Pieters. Hello Veerle. How are you doing today?</p>
<p>Veerle: Hi, Vitaly. I’m doing smashingly good.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s wonderful to hear. I mean, I know you... I don’t know, I remember vividly this moment, I don’t know, it feels like maybe 15 years ago or so when you were posting a lot of articles on your blog about CSS and design and CSS tutorials and all these things.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I need to hear your story. I need to know-</p>
<p>Veerle: Where’s the time?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yes. I mean, I know that you always had a lot of interest in art and drawings and design, but I’m wondering, how did you then come to this workplace? And what excited you about it back then? Why?</p>
<p>Veerle: So, not sure. I should maybe start at the very beginning. I started as a freelance designer, so that was still the early nineties back then, so no internet yet. But the first five years, I tried to make my way in designing for small agencies, ad agencies, doing print work and trying... Yeah, it was right from school actually, which was hard. But then in ’97... So the first five years, I really struggled. And I actually didn’t make any money, but I didn’t give up. I was at the point, should I look for a full-time job or not? But I kind of stick to it. I met Geert then, and actually, when the web was coming, we were kind of interested in it because I remember with my Macintosh back then, I had trouble. And not that I had always trouble, but there was a moment that I had trouble with my printer. And the guy, the technician came and he said, “I’m going to look for if there’s an update and the driver from the print driver.” And he was always mentioning, “Yeah, we can download it from the internet.”</p>
<p>I was like, huh, on the internet, that’s interesting. Because afterwards, I saw the invoice and I was like, it cost me a lot. If I have trouble again, I should look into having an internet subscription. So, that’s how I started looking into what’s the internet? And then it was still text and not graphic. But then all of a sudden, things evolved. There was Netscape coming out, and all of a sudden you could have images in webpages and they became more and more graphically, the pages. So, I was interested in how do they create such page. So, I was looking at... There were basic tools. I remember Bare Bones BBEdit. That was one of the-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. Wow, this brings back memories, I have to say.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. And there was another little tool I was thinking. Was it from... It was visually. Page. It’s something with page.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, I don’t remember anymore, but I know exactly the kind of tool that you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Veerle: If it’s from Adobe, I’m not sure. Anyhow, I looked into how a page was created, and I remember that it motivated me. Maybe this is the future. If it becomes more graphically, it can become your job.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right. But you never abandoned print, right? You never really said, okay, I’m not going to do print anymore. I’m just going all web. So, you were doing mixture of both, so you might have some project which you can kind of-</p>
<p>Veerle: Always.</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... partly print and partly digital?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yes. Yes. And also, at that time, I remember there was... Well, a bit later, you had Flash from Macromedia Flash. That was becoming popular. And actually, a little bit before that, you have Macromedia director to create CD-ROMs. I’ve had a couple of projects in that direction as well, which were really big challenges because it needed a lot of testing, Mac and Windows. It was rather technical. I remember we worked also with a freelancer back then, a very good freelancer who knew the scripting a lot of, because it was a lot of coding work as well to create such a CD-ROMs. And with Flash, we also made, not purely for the web actually, but a lot of presentations for ad agencies. Flash-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... a bit of the new... Back then, it was the more graphical PowerPoint thing, but more really, well, presentations. We did that as well.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: So, it was always a mixture of everything together, interactive and print. Meanwhile, we also did logo design and brochures.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean, I think when I look at your portfolio, I think you’ve done everything, everything, everything.</p>
<p>Veerle: I remember the app now. PageMill.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, I don’t know-</p>
<p>Veerle: The visual editor. Do you know?</p>
<p>Vitaly: No. So, I got on the web somewhere like 1999, right? And actually, it’s funny that we’re saying that because we just had a conversation with with a friend, and there was this notion that came up that I remember the time before the internet existed, and some of the new generations, they just don’t know that time before the internet existed, right? So, I’m wondering, do you remember that moment when you actually saw the web for the first time or anything that... Maybe not for the first time, but where you were actually understanding what you’re seeing? What is this?</p>
<p>Veerle: At the first time... Yeah, the first time was text, and I wasn’t making the connection with my profession at all.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: But then I think once... I try to remember the exact moment of... I think things changed when GoLive. Do you remember micro-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, GoLive was-</p>
<p>Veerle: Was it Macromedia?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Macromedia GoLive. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. That’s really the trick for me. Yeah. And then it was evolving fast to design webpages basically.</p>
<p>Vitaly: One thing I learned about you as well, because I was just curious, just researching a little bit. So, you’re actually left-handed, but then you taught yourself how to write right so you become right handed.</p>
<p>Veerle: Not myself.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Not yourself.</p>
<p>Veerle: It was in school. I mean, first... Let me say here in English. When you’re six years old and you start to learn to write and-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: Well, as a little kid, I say toddler-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, when you are four or five years old, the teacher is trying to teach you to write your name. So, they write your name on the board.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: And for me, it was like drawing my name. I didn’t understand letters at that age. I was drawing them mirrorly, in mirror. I don’t know how or why something in my brain is, yeah, wrongly wired, I guess.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right, but-</p>
<p>Veerle: I saw it, and I didn’t understand. My mom was always saying, “Look, Veerle has written her name.” And she was holding it in front of the mirror, so everybody saw them correctly, my name correctly. Then I didn’t understand why they’re already making such a fuss. I didn’t get it. I was too little to understand.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But how does this work? Does it mean that you can actually write with both left hand and right hand, your name, everything?</p>
<p>Veerle: I can, actually.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, this is your magical power. Have you been using the magical power? So, what would be... So your mouse, is it then in the left hand or in the right hand, or you’re using a trackpad?</p>
<p>Veerle: Right, my right hand. Yeah, that’s why also I have sometimes trouble with those drawing Wacoms.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Wacom tablets.</p>
<p>Veerle: Tablets. Tablets. Sorry, yeah. Yeah. It’s like I’m used to use my right hand for the mouse, but then drawing is with my left hand. So, I was always like, I don’t know, in some kind of dilemma.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right. Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: Should I use my left hand? Should I use my right hand? So, it was always a mix up and a struggle to use it properly.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: On one hand, it was a good thing because I could use my right hand for the things I’m used to with the mouse, and then switch to left for when I want to draw, but it was confusing me, and also a bit frustrating me because it was always which hands to use. That’s why I like drawing on the iPad, because then I have the pencil in my hand and I’m just drawing, and the rest I can do with my finger or... It’s less confusing or-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Sure. So, then also speaking about the tools that you’re using, I’m curious. So, you’re using an iPad. What tools do you use to get these ideas out into this world? Do you still sketch in the sketchbook first, and then you go into an iPad? Or what tools do you use to bring your ideas to life?</p>
<p>Veerle: I still use pencil and paper a lot. I don’t know why, because on an iPad, you can do it actually as good, as fast as possible. But somehow, I don’t know. I like having my sketchbook in my hands and draw on paper. Maybe it’s just that old fashioned maybe.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I can imagine you going in the garden, and then you sit down maybe. And you say, okay, now I’m going to come up with all these wonderful ideas and then bring it into world, right?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, sometimes, if weather permits and time permits. Sometimes I don’t have enough time to do it actually, sketch and... Sometimes it’s directly an illustrator. It’s weird to say that. But let’s say I have this client and I’m doing a lot of icon designs now for them, and they want an icon. I’m not saying that my deadline is three hours, but they is expected to have it done the same day. So, I’m often googling. It’s not very common icons, like hamburger menu or a home icon. It’s more very technical and specific. So, I enter some keywords in Google and see what comes up. And I usually end up with icon at the end or illustration icon. And I browse through the ideas, the concepts that I see, like I don’t know, a basket or a-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Sure.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... I don’t know, a pencil or something. And I say, okay, I can use that, or a house icon.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. But also after all these projects that you must have heard over all these years, do you feel like, I don’t know, whenever my client comes to you with a particular issue, particular problem, particular project, you’re like, “Okay, I’ve done this before. I think I’m pretty comfortable just going in, and just I can start right away in Illustrator?” Do you feel like you always need this kind of ideation phase, brainstorming phase beforehand to just get in? Or do you feel like... Because this is something that happens to me sometimes.</p>
<p>Whenever I have to write about anything, sometimes you give me any topic, I think I can start comfortably, and with any topic, I mean not necessarily about law, let’s say, or about physics, right? But anything design, I think I can start all the time. I need to do research and come up with all the points and all that, but I can start easily. And I think that the most difficult part sometimes for me to reach, just start, to kind of have a place where I want to go from. And then I kind of explore when to go. Is it similar for you? Would you say that every single project requires you to sit down to research, to try to understand what is it exactly that the needs are, and then design from scratch every time?</p>
<p>Veerle: It depends. Usually, I need some time to have do some rich research, instead of starting just right away from scratch. But I have a couple of clients where I do a lot of work for them, and I know their style and I immediately know the direction, and then I don’t have to do that. But that’s usually layout things that need a bit less of actual new design work. Sometimes I can then recuperate things already created and I’m making a variation of it and built further on that same concept because it needs to be in the same line, in the same direction. But if it’s a new project, a new client, then no. I don’t think I can do, okay, jump directly and Illustrator, or in InDesign or whatever, and start straight away. I always have to browse around for ideas and do some sketching, do some research before. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Do you have collage books that we used to have in the day where you would have all the different topics kind of put together, and whenever we have a projects related to healthcare, you have your healthcare folder with all the projects related to healthcare or anything like that.. or something like that?</p>
<p>Veerle: No. What I sometimes do is also... I don’t know if the app, Milanote?</p>
<p>Vitaly: It sounds very familiar, yes.</p>
<p>Veerle: It is an app that I like to use to gather all the things that I like that I come across and I found relevant to the project. It can either be a design style, a color palette, sometimes even sometimes that is not really related to the project, but an element in there that I like, a composition or mood boarding.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, mood boarding. I mean, actually talking about that, your inspiration stream has been going now for I don’t know how many decades, I think. Because I remember vividly for projects that I had, because I also do with the consultancy every now and again, right? And then we’re speaking with designers about, okay, what would be the style that we would be pursuing here? Would it be going that direction? More playful, less playful, more formal, less formal.” I’ll say, “Oh no, you just go to Veerle. Just go to Veerle.” This is like a-</p>
<p>Veerle: Thank you.</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... a showcase or a gallery of all the different styles. But this is really interesting for me, because I tried to explain.. I was telling to my partner that I’m going to interview you for the podcast and we’re going to have a little session. And she asked me, “Oh, she’s a illustrator. Oh, that’s great,” because we also Belgium a lot. And she asked me, “So, what kind of style is it? What kind of illustration style?” And I almost stuck. I couldn’t tell, because the only thing I could say is that it’s vibrant, it’s playful, it’s colorful, it’s living. This is what I came up with. So, I’m wondering how would you describe your style, or do you have many?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, I think I have many. It’s a bit... I think I try to adapt to what a client wants, because a project that I’ve been working on the past month is a book for a client, one of a long-term client that I love working with. And every page is an illustration. And at first, I remember that I tried to set a style for those illustrations and it’s with people. And I thought like, okay, I’m going to keep them very simple, and I gave them a blue skin, very fantasy. I thought if I use blue, it’s also colorless. All kind of people can be that. It can be visualized or represented by blue figures. But she didn’t like it.</p>
<p>And then she showed me, I like this and that style, because I presented also to her, in which direction should I go? And she picked a couple of pictures, of images that I presented to her. And so I had to change my style a little bit. So, that’s why I always think if people ask me, “What is your design style?” I don’t have a very specific style, but I think the way you describe it could work. I mean, colorful for sure.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, it’s colorful, for sure.</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s always try to include it to make it a bit playful, depending on the project. But there’re usually the restrictions.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: The client of course, wants this and it’s not like I’m a pure illustrator that has this style and the client comes to me because of this style, and I stick to very strictly... How do you say it? This style.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. But I mean-</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s a bit broader.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, but it’s very difficult for me to imagine you working on one of those corporate dry booklets. I mean, maybe you have, of course, but I just cannot imagine that. Maybe I should be diving a bit more into your inspiration stream.</p>
<p>Veerle: Well, the inspiration stream is, of course, not mine.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, yeah, sure. But I mean, it’s also collected by you, by yourself.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, there are all these different styles, but I cannot spot any dry — super dry — corporate style there.</p>
<p>Veerle: No. No.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s probably not-</p>
<p>Veerle: That doesn’t speak to me usually. Yes. True. So, that reflects to my own style of design.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I’m wondering, that’s probably also something that many people might be wondering. So, because you’ve been in the industry for quite a long time, when do you think you had this moment when you realize, okay, I can now work with the Facebooks and the Googles and the big companies? How did this happen? When did you experience this kind of, I wouldn’t say breakthrough, but it’s more like a position where you felt like, oh wow, I feel very comfortable now with this space, speed, design in general, and I’m working now with big clients. Because normally... I think that many people listening to this now, maybe starting out as designers, they might be wondering, how do you even get there? It seems like such a remote, distant dream to be working with this clients. So, what would you tell them? And how was it for you?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, for me, it was, of course, due to the block that I got a breakthrough, become popular within the world of web design and everything. So, due to conferences and... I don’t know.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, you kind of started getting more visible, is that... So, basically-</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... how did it work for you? So, for the blog, did you have a schedule, like, okay, I’m going to write at least once a week or month or anything like that?</p>
<p>Veerle: No, it was more like when I had time. And back in that day, around I’m talking like 2004, 2008, that period was most that I spent weekends and everything, hours writing for the blog. And yeah, I just made time. I didn’t go biking either back then.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, now you can have the luxury of going biking, right?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. But still, it’s not like I can, how you say, take a holiday or sit on my lazy As and do nothing. I have to work hard still to make living-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... unfortunately. But back then, I got more visibility, I think, and that’s how they reached out to me for work. Before, just when the internet was... Before I started blogging... And so I had declined the Library of Congress. That was also because of my knowledge of director, Macromedia director, because you could also do interactive gaming things online with that app. And I remember that the site got nominated by Macromedia back then I was site of the day and site of the week. And so that’s how they got in contact with me. And for Google and Facebook, that was actually just the same because I was then in the CSS gallery from here and there, galleries and awards and stuff. And that’s how I ended up working for Facebook on a project. I never had it in my portfolio, unfortunately. It’s something that never got launched. I did do a nice creative job for them, but it was earlier.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. I think also for me, it’s always been about two things, I think. I always felt like there is a very, very strong need to be present, to share. And I mean, this is also something that has been very close to your heart because you’ve been sharing, and you are still sharing a lot. So, this sharing has always been a very important part of me. And I think that this is through sharing, where you actually not only get to meet wonderful people who like your work, who talk to you about your work, and maybe they share with you their work, but this is also how you kind of spread the word about yourself.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, that has been always a kind of very, very-</p>
<p>Veerle: That’s actually the most important part. That’s how I got into the CSS galleries. Yeah. Actually, a most important part that I left out there.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I think so as well.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Because I started that tutorial. There was one tutorial that I shared towards designers who wanted to learn a little bit of coding. How can I code a homepage? And I explained in different parts, here’s how you create a header, here’s how you create the page itself, header, content, footer. Now, I’m explaining it very, very short but... And I explained it going from actually designing it in Photoshop, and then cutting it in parts and-</p>
<p>Vitaly: There a slicing and everything.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... explain how CCS work, very, very basic steps, and then very rudimentary language, very simple so that everyone could understand it. And that got so popular and picked up by so many sites who were way, way bigger than me. But that elevated me up there amongst all the others, and I got an invited for speaking at conference.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s right.</p>
<p>Veerle: So, that’s how the ball got rolling it. And then the blog was redesigned and it got an award again, and it never stopped.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. Are you planning on the fifth redesign at some point?</p>
<p>Veerle: At the moment, I’m actually doing a little... It’s not a redesign, but I’m fiddling with the colors and things a little bit</p>
<p>Vitaly: Like you always are, so I didn’t expect anything else. Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. It’s always harder for yourself, doing-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yes.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... improvements on work, and also finding the time.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Veerle: I thought I would’ve launched it by now, the things that I’ve done, I worked a little bit over the Christmas period, but I’m still in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, of course. I’m also speaking with a lot of junior designers, and very often what I hear is that they have a hard time kind of putting the word out there. So, I feel like maybe back then, for me, it was quite straightforward because there was not much. I mean, there were maybe what handful of people, maybe 30, 40 people who are writing and blogging and being very public about this and sharing.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Now, I feel like everybody’s posting. And now, you can generate a perfect SEO optimized, shared ChatGPT powered article about design and so on. Do you think that you would be doing the same today if you were in this position, let’s say, not 20 years ago, but today? Would you be trying to be visible on TikTok and Instagram or LinkedIn? I don’t know what would be-</p>
<p>Veerle: I think I probably would. I’m not sure. It’s hard. It’s a whole different period. For us, it was all so very new. I remember Twitter. I remember Jeremy Kieth told me like, “Hey, there’s this Twitter thing. You should check it out.” I was like, huh, Twitter, what’s that? And he explained, and I was like, okay, I’m going to check it out. That’s how I got on Twitter back then.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: Because we were all on... I don’t know if you were too on Pownce?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh yes, I remember that. I know for sure that I registered an account. I registered an account on Pownce, and then I think I never posted anything. I mean, there were a couple of apps or a couple of sites, social media sites back then. But I think... I don’t know, for me, I always liked... I liked to write. It was all about writing for me. Because when I was growing up, I wanted to be a writer. Well, that didn’t happen, but I really wanted to write. But it’s not about me. I mean, this podcast, of course, is not about me.</p>
<p>Veerle: But I think I would do TikTok and Instagram. Now, I’ve been using my Instagram always for just photos and everything, but I think I would more try to be visible with my work via Instagram and TikTok and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think so. I mean, I also remember that one thing that’s really excited me back then, I think it’s still the same, I mean, every single day, I happened to meet, even without being kind of proactive about it, but I happen to stumble upon work people just accidentally, either by searching or by going through some feeds or LinkedIn on... I tend to use Twitter less these days. I always find interesting people. And this is something that’s really keeps motivating me as well. I feel like I always learn somebody who is doing something absolutely incredible. And so this is something that I can also then take and learn from. And I always try to take that step to reach out to that person and just talk to them or exchange thoughts or work or whatever. That’s really, really... I mean, that’s that kind of growth of networking I saw. That’s really, really, really important.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, that’s what I tried actually also, reaching out to people that you admire.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And they reply back. It’s not like they’re in the castle somewhere. Very often, they would reply back. And those emails from those people who do reply back, I remember them forever. I mean, sometimes I’d think, well, why bother sending a message to somebody who has been, I don’t know, designing a famous typeface or something. They reply, and then this thing really keeps me kind of fueling and motivating me.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Maybe turning the kind of direction of the conversation a little bit, I’m also curious to know maybe some of the really challenging projects you worked on. What would we say, looking back now, what was some of the most difficult design projects or illustration projects that you were involved with, as long as you can speak about it?</p>
<p>Veerle: I think the most challenging one was actually in the time before internet, the CD-ROM thing. We did... Well, Geert and I did a project for Ernst &amp; Young and a CD-ROM project called Oscan. It was a bit corporate, but it was a lot of creativity. At first, we actually had to win it because it was between us and another agency. So, we got the job eventually, but it was from A to Z, from production, packaging. It was actually a browser hand. The packaging, it was a big browser hand that you could open, and the CD-ROM was sitting in the browser hand. It was in five languages. There was a lot of design work, and it was a lot of technicalities also with testing on windows. That was actually the most challenging, because it was first, to get the job. And then I think we worked on it for more than a year to get it finished. Also with voiceover. It was with voiceover and was very graphically.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, I assume that must have taken quite a bit of time, quite a bit of time.</p>
<p>Veerle: It was. Like I said, we worked more than a year on it. The other one was for a screensaver.</p>
<p>Vitaly: A screensaver?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yes. It was called Caveman, and it was with a caveman. And it was like with volcanoes, and it was very fun. But I remember how the result was still like... Now, you would look at it, it was like from the dark ages, the pixels and the stuff. Yeah, it was early nineties, but it was so fun.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, I can imagine. So, would you say that coming back and looking back, do you find that doing design work now is easier or more difficult?</p>
<p>Veerle: That’s hard to say.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean, of course, we have much better technology and tooling and all of that.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. So, I would say in that respect, it’s easier, but it’s also difficult in a way that there’s so much apps, so to learn. On the other hand, back then it was also a lot to learn. The creative challenges, of course, the same. The tools are easier. Because I remember in the early days when I used Illustrator... Now, I can do stuff in two clicks to say it simple. And back then, it was like it would take me more than two hours to do the same.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. So, you’ve also done quite a bit of illustration work. I’m curious... So at some point, you just knew that, okay, so you’ve been drawing and you’ve been designing, you’ve been this, and from everything from packaging to stationary and everything, right? Did you want to just say something like, “Okay, I’m done with this. I want to explore fonts. I want to design fonts now, or “I’m done with this. I’m going to go for music. I’m going to create music now?” Did you have this moments where you said, “Okay, I want to explore something entirely different?” Or maybe it was just a different style illustration that you would be experimenting. Because for me... The reason why I’m asking is because I have this problem that I always feel like I’m jumping in with both feet in some topic. And then I realize, oh, I’m done with it now. I want to do something and tiredly different.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And then I jumped from UX to design, to front end, to performance accessibility. That’s been like the path for my entire journey so far. What is it like for you.</p>
<p>Veerle: I think because my jobs, and I mean the projects that we work on are so diverse, that I always feel like there’s something different. Tomorrow, I work on, this could be illustration work. And the week after, I work on print. Then I work again on some website, then again on some apps, app design. Because of this constant mixture, I don’t have the urge to do something entirely different because it’s always something different. In a way, I can see what you say. That has been on my mind actually, to design a farm. This has always something like, oh, that would be so great to do, design a font. On the other hand, I think there are so many... How do you say? It’s such a specialty that I think maybe I won’t be good at it. Because to design a font, it’s not simple. So, it’s a good font, I mean, really good font. If it’s a script font and from the, you know—</p>
<p>Vitaly: Handwritten font, or so...</p>
<p>Veerle: And even that... Yeah, you can say, okay. But if it’s a sans or sans serif, there’s so many things to take into account, like the letter O needs to be a little bit bigger because it’s round. And then you have all these little things that you have to keep in mind. And then there is the tracking and the kerning and everything.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Sure. Sure. That’s a science for itself, of course.</p>
<p>Veerle: I think I gave up the idea because of it. I actually did design a font belt, not font font, but there was once a project from a guy. I think it’s the guy who founded Skillshare, actually. He had a book project way back before he founded Skillshare, grab back book or something. And he asked many creative people to do something totally out of their comfort zone, totally different. And for me, my task was create a font. So, others had another task, like create a poster or... So, that was the only time. I actually designed a font, but it was not like a font with font files and everything. It was pure on design and it got printed in a book. So, it never got further than that.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Maybe it’s not even necessary anymore, because of course, we have wonderful power of artificial intelligence coming our way. And I’m really had to ask this question, of course. And we could just ask, I don’t know, AI to just design a font of our dreams.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But I am wondering-</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s easy.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I am wondering at this point, how do you see... I mean, we have all these tools from Midjourney to, I mean DALL-E And so many others, all these AI tools that allow you to generate an image or support you in some way, assist you in some way to get that perfect photo, that perfect illustration, to that perfect landscape, that perfect whatever. How do you see that? Do you actually in some way use or think about using AI for your work, or do you feel like this cannot-</p>
<p>Veerle: So far, I haven’t used it. No. In a way, I kind of see it... It’s back in the days when Photoshop introduced effects and we’re all like, “Whoa, yes, let’s try it out.” And it’s like something new and everybody’s jumping at it. Like we say in Dutch, fly on a shit... I find it a little bit, I don’t know, artificial, too artificial, like the word says. It’s probably going to serve us as help, and in a way, as a tool. Yeah. But on the other hand, I have so many questions about it. I don’t know if you heard... And I was already asking that same question in my head, what about copyrights, the photos that is in there, that they’re using? And I, not so long ago, I think a couple of days ago, I read something about Getty Images asking the question like, “Hey, you guys are using pictures, images of our Getty Images collection.” So, I think they’re going, they’re going to be trouble here and there as well. It’s not that easy—</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. This is actually still a big question that is, to be honest, that seems to be, I wouldn’t say dismissed, but it is not taken seriously often. But you still see some issues where many of the applications that are generating those images, they actually have, in the terms and conditions, a very clear statement that this only for personal use and so on and so forth. But in general, of course, whenever we think about this, one big question that comes in my way is that obviously whenever artificial intelligence is generating those images, these images have a copyrighted designed by humans. So if there were no humans, there wouldn’t be any design work done by AI, right? And then the question is, there is no credit, there is no compensation. Of course, there is mining, data mining.</p>
<p>And this, of course, brings up questions. I mean, when I was looking and playing with DALL-E and Midjourney, and there are so many tools at this point, I was very impressed with results. I mean, I was seriously impressed with the results. I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between an actual photo or that kind of artwork... Maybe it looked a little bit too perfect at times, and sometimes it had these really strange things where everything looks perfect, but then a person has six fingers instead of five.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yes, I saw something similar.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, those things happen every now and again. But if you just focus on the face, let’s say, then this problem doesn’t occur. But then there is kind of something almost magical where you can... I mean, at this point, I think also in Figma, you have these options to say, dear Figma, I need a photo of a barista in front of tiled, I don’t know, tiled bakery, whatever in Portugal, and the picture, the result is incredible. I mean, I have to say that this is absolutely stunning. The question of course that I’m asking myself and that many of my colleagues are wondering about is, what does it mean? So, would we, as designers or researchers, use it, or would we be trying to fight the war against the windmill? Because there are so many of those tools. But that’s a question that hasn’t been answered yet. And again, it has raises a lot of ethical concerns as well.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. Especially the last thing you mentioned, ethical concerns. And I don’t know, in a way, I can see its purpose, but then on the other hand, I don’t know if it goes that far that it’s overtakes our entire job. I mean, I don’t know what’s-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, it’s hard to say, because I was this case, I don’t know if you’ve heard about it or not, where there was a project, where an administrator was working on a project. And then I think three or four months in project, he was fired. And what the owners of the company then said, “Well, you’ve designed 15 administration. We can now design the rest with AI.”</p>
<p>Veerle: Okay.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, we can mine your style and maybe a few more images, or millions of images around the world, and we can replicate your style. So, we don’t necessarily need you to be on this project. I was like, wow. So, those things happened.</p>
<p>Veerle: Wow. And that happened and he didn’t... Did he say, “Okay, here are the royalties?”</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean, he did the work, and the first, I think 15 images or so, they were paid for, but the rest was kind of canceled, because you can produce the results with a handful of images, and obviously a lot of other data around. So that, again, raises some questions and concerns.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yes.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, I’m not quite sure-</p>
<p>Veerle: That’s true.</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... what we’re getting with this.</p>
<p>Veerle: Then we have to put a copyrighting in our estimate before taking on the job, like, here’s the copyright.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I think in the end-</p>
<p>Veerle: Because otherwise, no. I mean-</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think in some way, this will become probably something that we will be including in our contract or that we’ll be dealing with as terms and conditions. But I’m very hopeful.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yes, terms and conditions...</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think the future looks bright, so we shouldn’t be... I mean, obviously we need to be very careful about what we’re doing there and how we’re managing all that, but I’m hopeful that the community is better off with AI. We shouldn’t be fighting AI too much.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I think it’ll have its place, but I don’t think it’ll be that far, like it overtakes our job. I don’t know. I don’t think that. I don’t believe that. I mean, we’re all still human. I mean, needs the human emotional touch and everything. But I see it as... I hope we can use it as a tool and not that it doesn’t overtake us.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. So, do you think, Veerle, that maybe four years, three, four, five years from now, you’ll be writing a nice article on your blog about how to use AI to speed up your creative process?</p>
<p>Veerle: Who knows? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Maybe.</p>
<p>Veerle: Or it will, I don’t know, get a very bad taste and a very bad, I don’t know, thing, reputation. But I don’t know if it go will go that far, and it’ll not survive. I don’t think it’ll probably survive.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, maybe there is something good around that as well. Because while the AI is busy doing the design work, you can go on biking, which is why I have to ask you about, as we are wrapping up here, maybe you could share us with some of the most memorable destinations that you actually have traveled to on your bike. What were some of the highlights in your journey? And what was the longest trip you ever taken?</p>
<p>Veerle: I think the longest trip or the longest ride was 207 kilometers.</p>
<p>Vitaly: 207. Wow.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. But it was in Belgium. I think-</p>
<p>Vitaly: It was all around Belgium still?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, I sometimes go towards direction of France and the Netherlands over the border, but it’s not that I have biked in some destination far away. So, the Balearic Islands, that’s the forest where I’ve rode my bike. It’s more in my own country that I bike. But there’s so many little roads here. I’m still amazed by how many roads there are. And then that I still ride roads that I haven’t ridden. And they’re like, I don’t know, 15 kilometers from here, or 10 kilometers from here. And I say like, huh, didn’t discover that one. I’m always thinking I should... I put my bike rides on Strava, and I think you can look up a heat map. And if I do Flanders, the heat map of Flanders, it’s really dense. I’ve ridden over and over and over. If I see the total kilometers that I’ve ridden, I’ve ridden a couple of times around the world.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh wow.</p>
<p>Veerle: The kilometers.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That could be. But I think-</p>
<p>Veerle: Like whoa, that’s mind blowing.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah.</p>
<p>Veerle: I ride my bike more than I drive my car.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh wow.</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s like double the kilometers in a year.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. But maybe we should import you into Black Forest, and I’d be very curious how far you go there.</p>
<p>Veerle: It is one of the locations I would really love to go. My local bakery that I go every weekend, he’s like a fan of that area. He’s also a mountain biker. And every year, his holiday is always the Black Forest, and he’s always bragging about it. “If you want some rights from there, I can share you some, and just let me know when you go.”</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, I think maybe that’s a sign for you to keep in the loop. Please let us know question when you happen to be there. Maybe as a final question here to wrap up, I always ask this question because it always gives me kind of a clue about the motivation, the dreams that guests like to have. Do you have a particular dream project that you ever wished you could work with? So, if somebody from any company could listen to this now or in the future think maybe Veerle wants to work on this incredible project, we should reach out. So, if you had a dream project or if you have a dream project, what would you desperately want to work on one day?</p>
<p>Veerle: Oh man. Well, actually dream project would be if the client says that would’ve really already make it, that would already make me very happy, if I have a lot of time to work on a project, like if they say-</p>
<p>Vitaly: A year.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... you do your thing. I love to have boundaries, but if you can go to your full potential of your creativity and there’s like no deadline... Usually, they clients want things done too fast. And usually, you always end up, like hmm, if I had a little bit more time, I would made this better and better. The things that end up in my portfolio, the things that I’m happy with, that I like, there’s so many work, it’s like 10% of all the work I’ve done, because a lot of projects are like that it has to go so fast, or they put it online, but they have implemented it wrongly, stuff like that. There’s always something. So, my dream project would be if there’s a project from A to Z, it’s like perfect done, a lot of creativity. It can be anything really. I’ve always dreamt in school that I would end up in packaging design. I haven’t done much packaging design, but if I could do, create a brand logo, and then the whole packaging of the interior of, if it’s a shop, an interior, the building, whatever.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But you already did design a logo for an airline, isn’t that right?</p>
<p>Veerle: Ah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, it was actually... It was not a big project. It sounds like because it’s for an airline, it’s like big. It was actually like, we want an icon on the plane, and our logo has this colors, but we want an icon. And so I kind of designed a star shape, I think. And that was like... Yeah, I was proud of it because it was on a plane.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Did you fly the plane with your icon?</p>
<p>Veerle: No. No.</p>
<p>Vitaly: No?</p>
<p>Veerle: No.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, maybe that... So if anybody listening to this owns an airline or a train or a bike or anything and is willing to maybe put an icon... That would be nice to have a bike with your work on it. That’d be nice.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yea.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yes. So, please get in touch with Veerle. I’m sure she would appreciate that. All right.</p>
<p>Veerle: Thank you.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, we’ve been learning quite a bit about illustration and design and workflow, and AI even a little bit in here, but what have you been learning about lately, Veerle? Anything that you’ve learned, or maybe outside of the scope of design altogether, anything that you felt like, oh wow, I didn’t know that earlier, so here we go, now I know it?</p>
<p>Veerle: Well, actually I’m currently working with Figma, and I didn’t know it. It’s because of the project with the client, the developer is also using Figma and other designers in the team are using Figma. And otherwise, I would jump in with my Adobe XD and I thought like, okay, it’s to speed up the process, and also to work together on something and share. It’s not that you can’t do it with Adobe XD, but they’re already using Figma. So, I’m learning Figma. It’s the first steps, but yeah, it’s been fun, actually. I’m liking it. You can also copy paste from Illustrate, for me is very important.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I can imagine.</p>
<p>Veerle: I’m doing most of icon design work. It’s for webpages and a web app. And so it’s handy that I can copy paste. And I’m also using... I’m also trying out Affinity Designer. I’ve been working in it a couple of times now. It’s also very early phase. So, I think I’ve spent, if it’s an hour already. So, it’s really short time, but yeah, I’m liking it so far. So, I’m stepping out of the Adobe environment a little bit to learn a little bit more. Yeah. And then I think on my iPad, I’m doing a lot of water coloring-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... coloring digitally, trying out a couple of brushes. And so that’s also a bit new.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Never stop learning then.</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah, never stop learning.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So maybe now, if you, at some point in the future, will find a nice Figma tutorial on Veerle’s blog, you know what direction-</p>
<p>Veerle: Who knows?</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... she ended up going. Well, if you, the listener, would like to hear more from Veerle, you can find her on Twitter where she’s @vpieters, and also in home homepage, of course, which is veerle.duoh.com, veerle.duoh.com.</p>
<p>Veerle: I’m actually not much on Twitter anymore-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Not much on Twitter.</p>
<p>Veerle: ... to be honest.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, is it now... What is cool at this point?</p>
<p>Veerle: Actually not-</p>
<p>Vitaly: So, what-</p>
<p>Veerle: Mastodon.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Mastodon. So, are you on Mastodon a lot?</p>
<p>Veerle: Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. And I’m going... You asked me, you are redesigning my blog. I’m actually also going to do a lot of writing on my blog. Little short post that I tend to do before on Twitter. I’m moving it a bit to my blog.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right.</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s called Side Notes. I’m going to call it Side Notes, but it’s still in the making. I’ll try to make good progress that it’s will be online very soon to replace the whole Twitter feed. But up until now, I’m posting the things on Mastodon.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That sounds-</p>
<p>Veerle: It’s actually what I did before Twitter was here. So, I’m picking up from way back.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Sure. But we’ll be following along for sure. So with this in mind, thank you so much for joining us today, Veerle. Do you have any parting words of wisdom? Imagine somebody listening to this 20 years from now and thinking, how did they design things back in the day? Do you have a message to the future or share-</p>
<p>Veerle: Message to the future.</p>
<p>Vitaly: ... I don’t know, words of wisdom to people out there?</p>
<p>Veerle: I think always keep on learning, I think. And open your eyes, try to soak in inspiration from everywhere, even just go outside, find inspiration in nature. Look around, open your eyes. If you are walking in the streets, look at the signs, signs of shops and everything. Yeah, try to keep an open vision, I think, and never stop learning. These are my words.</p>

The design we’ll discuss is actually one I got to work on for a client (modified slightly to a demo case). It will cover two big use cases of a CSS grid: </p>
<ol>
<li>Having a static grid where we define the specified start and end points for each element;</li>
<li>Using CSS grid template areas to reorder a simple HTML layout easily without updating the HTML. </li>
</ol>
<p>As a bonus, we will also touch on <code>object-fit</code> and <code>aspect-ratio</code>, which come in handy as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-print-like-website-layout-css-grid-areas/1-combined-design-desktop-mobile-versions.png" /></p>
<p>Here you can see the design we will be implementing: desktop on the left and a cropped version for mobile on the right (imagine the mobile view to continue with sections 3 and 4). There is quite a lot going on here, and nothing really fits into neat rows and columns. The images are laid out on an uneven grid, sometimes even overlapping, and we have some narrow text and a numbering element that double as a design element.</p>
Artisanal Image Layouts
<p>Let us first look at the image grid elements inside each colored component. While we have four colored components, there are only two variants that get repeated. For easier comparison, I have cut the desktop version in half and put the two halves next to one another — this makes it easier to compare. As you can see, the first and third are the same, as are the second and fourth. If we compare just the first and second variants, they differ, but the basic building blocks are very similar (a full-sized background color, a big image block, a column with a number, and some text). Due to this, we can consider it the same component, just with two alternatives.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-print-like-website-layout-css-grid-areas/2-design-desktop-version-cut-in-half.png" /></p>
<p>In the olden days, we would have had to do the image grid in Photoshop and then add it as one image to the page. Obviously, we could still do this, but that solution has never been particularly good for responsive websites, and using the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/#the-art-direction-use-case">picture element</a> would work, but we would have to do several layouts in Photoshop and redo everything if we want to change a picture. We would need to do this every time this element gets added with different pictures.</p>
<p>But we wouldn’t be at this part in this article if there wasn’t an alternative! For a while now, it has been <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">safe to use CSS grid</a>, and it is able to solve this layout quite neatly with only a few lines of CSS.</p>
<p>CSS Grid allows us to define a formal grid definition — columns and rows — on the parent element and specify for the children where they should go within the grid. We also get the same justify and align capabilities that flex offers. This removes a lot of the need for wrapping <code>div</code>s and also makes the CSS slimmer. </p>
<p>One thing to note: As a result, your graphical layout can be different from the document structure in HTML. </p>
<p>Screen readers will still rely on the HTML structure, though, so put the most important information first and try to keep everything in a sensible order. </p>
<p>Now let’s get to our images. What is it that we need at a minimum? A container for the images and the images themselves. And you know what? With CSS Grid, that is actually enough — say goodbye to five layers of wrapping <code>div</code>s!</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="grid image-grid-3-m4"&gt;
   &lt;img class="image-0 " src="" /&gt; 
   &lt;img class="image-1 " src="" /&gt;
   &lt;img class="image-2 " src="" /&gt;
   &lt;img class="image-3 " src="" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A bit more on the markup. To make the styling easier, I added an index to each image (since we want to re-use them, it has to be a class, not an ID) and two classes on the surrounding <code>div</code>, which we will use to define the base styling: a grid utility class and a second one used for identifying the variant. For the variant with three images on the left and a fourth on the right in desktop view, I spent some time thinking about how to best solve the fourth image’s problem: do we add it to the container with the other images and try and move it to the other side, or do we move it on mobile, and so on. In the end, I decided to add the fourth image in the container for the images but hide it on the desktop via CSS and have a separate <code>div</code> in a second location with the same image for displaying in the desktop version. Using <code>display:none</code> will also <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/">hide that version from screen readers</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basic HTML and our images in place, it is time to focus on the CSS. If you are completely new to a CSS grid, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/understanding-css-grid-container/">this helpful article</a> goes into the full syntax and explains it in detail. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the full syntax in this article.</p>
<p>First off, we need to define our grid. Since I had a design to work with, I used a tool that allowed me to put lines on top of the image, position one line at each edge of the image, and see the pixel dimensions in between. It would have been great if the designer had already used a formal grid and told me about it, but unfortunately, that was not the case, so I used the proportionate dimensions as an approximation of what I should use in the grid. Basically, I asked myself what the smallest common divisible number was for each — with some wiggle room — and used that. (Welcome to math class.) My goal was to have the same size for all grid columns and rows while being flexible on the number of columns or rows.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-print-like-website-layout-css-grid-areas/3-css-grid-design-layout-ruler-overlay.png" /></p>
<p>With this method, I determined that I wanted to have 14 columns on mobile and 7 rows plus some uniform gaps. This allowed me to approximate the distribution in the layout while keeping the aspect ratios close to what they had envisioned. Based on that, we get the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code>.grid {
  display: grid;
}

.image-grid-3-m4 {
  grid-template-rows: repeat(7, 1fr);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(14, 1fr);
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With these four lines of CSS, we have a grid that is ready to be filled. If you follow along, you will notice that the images are now filling one grid cell each in the first row. This is the automatic layout mechanism that the browser uses, and depending on what you want to do, it can be ideal for defining an evenly laid-out design in seconds.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-print-like-website-layout-css-grid-areas/4-css-grid-sections-design-layout.png" /></p>
<p>What is the minimum HTML for that? Again we do not need a lot of extras; a surrounding <code>div</code> and then one for each part is all that we need:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="images"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="numbering"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="single-image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For our example, all areas have a class name that identifies what they will hold later. If we look at the mobile layout, though, the number is on top of the images! The cool thing about a CSS grid is that you can layer elements. We already used that for the images above. As you can see, two of them overlap, and we can also do that for whole areas. The layering will be controlled by our old friend, the z-index. Same rules as always: the higher z-index wins and comes to the front.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s create two areas: one at the top with the images filling the area and the number as a top layer with most of it transparent to show the images, and the second area below for the text. We could use the grid columns and rows syntax we used earlier, but in this case, we can make our lives even easier with <code>grid-template-areas</code>. With this, you can add names to parts of your grid and then decide for each element which grid area it should appear in. Especially for the page or component frame, this is a much easier and faster way to work and be able to read it all again later than using all of the non-descript numbers.</p>
<p>I think this will be easier to understand with an example.</p>
<pre><code>.container {  
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 1.2rem;
  grid-auto-flow: row;
  grid-template-areas:
    "numerology"
    "text";
}

.images { grid-area: numerology; }

.numbering { grid-area: numerology; }

.text { grid-area: text; }
.single-image {display:none}
</code></pre>

<p>We define the container as a grid once again, add two rows to it, and then use ‘grid-template-areas’ to give these rows a name. The syntax for this is very unusual for CSS, but it gives you a mini-view of your layout: <code>Numerology</code> is the name of the cell in the first row and <code>Text</code> in the second.</p>
<p>With those rows now having names, we can easily position our elements. Both the images and the container for the number go into the first row, and the text will go to the second row. So in the example above, we add the <code>grid-area</code> to the CSS for the class we applied to the <code>div</code> in the HTML. With those few lines, we have defined the layout.</p>
<p>To achieve the overlay effect for the number, the white box will be in its container and gets a fixed width and height. We can then use <code>flex</code> to center it in the container.</p>
<p>But how do we get from this to the desktop version, you may ask? Pretty easily, actually! For the overall design of the website, we are already using a 14-column grid on the desktop for all elements. If we overlay the design with some grid markers, we see the widths everything should take approximately.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-print-like-website-layout-css-grid-areas/5-column-grid-desktop-overlay.png" /></p>
<p>Obviously, our named areas from the mobile view will not really help us for this version, but we can simply update them in a media query for our desktop view and also define different area names:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>.container {  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(14, minmax(0, 1fr));
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 1.2rem;
  grid-auto-flow: row;
  grid-template-areas:
    "images images images images images . numbering numbering numbering single-image single-image single-image single-image single-image"
    "images images images images images . text text text single-image single-image single-image single-image single-image";
}

.images { grid-area: images; }

.numbering { grid-area: numbering; }

.text { grid-area: text; }

.single-image { grid-area: single-image; }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let me be the first one to say that, yes, this is really not a pretty way of defining this, but unfortunately, the <code>template-areas</code> syntax does not include the repeat keyword as the column definition does. </p>
<p>But take a moment and have a closer look. What you can see is that we define the first five columns to belong to the <code>images</code> name in both rows, then we have a period, which means nothing goes here, then we have three columns for the <code>numbering</code> in row one and three for the <code>text</code> in row two, and at the end, five columns for <code>single-image</code>. Personally, I like to use an <a href="https://grid.layoutit.com/">online generator</a> that allows me to visually define these areas and copy the needed CSS.</p>
<p>Now with just under 20 lines of code, we have completely changed the layout without having touched the very simple HTML structure at all! But what about the alternative version for 2 and 4? They only use a slightly different layout, so why not add some classes for <code>.version-a</code> and <code>.version-b</code> on the container and have the <code>grid-template-areas</code> defined by that on the desktop? It is that simple. Look at the following:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>  .version-1 {
      grid-template-areas:
    "images images images images images . numbering numbering numbering single-image single-image single-image single-image single-image"

<p>To me, this is still pretty crazy, to be honest. For the longest time, a layout like this would have been completely out of reach or very complicated to make and having shared HTML between versions 1 and 2 would have been near impossible, at least for the complete HTML. Now we can just wave a magic wand and update where it should show up. Pretty heady stuff. </p>
<p>Another practical example where this helped me a lot was defining areas for a product detail page on an e-commerce website. Being able to move elements around to where they make sense in different contexts is amazing, but it also means that you need to adjust your mental model a bit to how HTML and CSS are connected. And this is even just the beginning. With container queries and layers, there is much on the horizon that will open up a lot more possibilities in the future, and I am totally here for it!</p>

<p>A good chunk of all websites out there runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the most basic, a website will usually use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> solutions (for computing power and data storage, respectively), and most likely also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> (as the content delivery network [CDN] to distribute the assets).</p>
<p>This stack works very well and is super powerful, but it is not dead easy to set up, as each of these services needs to be configured to interact with one another. And once that’s done, we need to configure the operating system and install the CMS, and anything else needed to run our software.</p>
<p>If all we need is to launch a website quickly and easily (for instance, to show the website under development to our client or to test a WordPress plugin), spending time to set up all these separate AWS services could be a bit too much.</p>
<p>This is why AWS created <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">Amazon Lightsail</a>, a service that aggregates the other services (EC2, S3, CloudFront, and a few others) via a simplified user interface to launch webservers with everything installed and configured (for both hardware and core software) and ready to be used.</p>
<p>With Lightsail, we can have our website up and running in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Unlike most AWS services, Lightsail has a flat pricing structure, with a fixed price per month. (In contrast, EC2 is charged per number of seconds of use; EBS — which provides the volumes to store data in EC2 — by the size and type of disk along with any additional provisioned IOPS; S3, by the size of the stored objects and duration of storage; and CloudFront, by the amount of data transferred.) This makes it way easier to estimate our AWS bill at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>You can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">try out Lightsail for free</a> for the first three months.</em></p>
<p>In this article, let’s explore how to launch a <strong>WordPress site</strong> in Lightsail in a quick and easy way.</p>
Creating A Lightsail Instance With WordPress Pre-Installed
<p>To access Lightsail, we head over to <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">lightsail.aws.amazon.com</a> (we need to be logged in to AWS).</p>
<p>Initially, our dashboard will be empty:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/1-lightsail-dashboard.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s click on “Create instance” to host a WordPress site.</p>
<p>We must select the location of the server, the platform to use (Linux/Unit or Windows), and what software to install (OS + Apps) via the provided blueprints. Please notice that the WordPress blueprint installs the latest version and that there are separate blueprints for WordPress as a single site and as a multisite.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/2-lightsail-dashboard-creating-instance.png" /></p>
<p>Choose a location that is as close as possible to your users to reduce the latency when accessing the site.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/3-lightsail-dashboard-choosing-instance-location.png" /></p>
<p>Lightsail has different prices based on how powerful the server is: <strong>The more traffic the website has, the more resources the server must have</strong>.</p>
<p>We can get a basic server that is good for testing for $3.50/month USD; for production, we’d rather start with a server at $5 or 10/month, monitor its traffic, and analyze (over time) if to upgrade it.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/4-lightsail-dashboard-Instance-price.png" /></p>
<p>We finally assign a name to the instance and click on “Create instance.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/5-lightsail-dashboard-assigning-name-instance.png" /></p>
<p>The instance will be created in the background. After less than 1 minute, it will be ready, and its status on the dashboard will change from “Pending” to “Running.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/6-lightsail-dashboard-instance-created.png" /></p>
<p>Please notice the “Terminal” icon right next to the instance’s name. In the sections below, we will be using it to connect to the instance via SSH and execute commands on the server.</p>
Attaching A Static IP
<p>When the instance is created, the IP assigned to it is “elastic,” which can change (for instance, when rebooting the server). So we must create a static IP and attach it to the instance so that it never changes.</p>
<p>For that, head over to the Networking tab and, under “Public IP,” click on “Attach static IP.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/7-wordpress-demo-elastic-IP.png" /></p>
<p>We must provide a name to identify the static IP.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/8-creating-static-IP.png" /></p>
<p>Click on “Create and attach,” upon which the server will now have a static IP associated with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/9-static-IP-attached-instance.png" /></p>
<p>We can now access our WordPress site in the browser under <code>http://{PUBLIC_IP}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/10-accessing-wordpress-site.png" /></p>
<p>Hello, WordPress site! 👋</p>
Accessing The WP Admin
<p>The WordPress admin’s username is <code>user</code>, and we need to retrieve the password from the server by connecting to it via SSH.</p>
<p>For that, we click on the “Terminal” icon next to the instance name (as seen earlier), upon which a new window opens up in the browser, with a CLI running on the instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/11-connecting-instance-via-SSH.png" /></p>
<p>Execute the following command to print the password on the screen.</p>
<pre><code>cat bitnami_application_password
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/12-printing-admin-password.png" /></p>
<p>Then highlight the password, and click on the orange clipboard icon (on the bottom right corner) to copy the password from the popping window.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/13-copying-password-clipboard.png" /></p>
<p>Head over to the WordPress admin screen under <code>http://{PUBLIC_IP}/wp-login.php</code>, and input the username and password.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/14-logging-into-wp-admin.png" /></p>
<p>Voilà, we are in.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/15-wordpress-sitelogged-into-wp-admin.png" /></p>
Using A Custom Domain
<p>Accessing the website straight from the public IP is not ideal, so let’s create a custom domain.</p>
<p>In your DNS service, create an <code>A</code> record mapping your domain or subdomain to the instance’s public IP (if you don’t have a domain, you can also <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/create/route-53-domain?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">register a new one via Lightsail</a>). I use AWS Route 53, but any DNS service will work.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/16-create-DNS-record-Route-53.png" /></p>
<p>We can now access the website via the chosen domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/17-access-site-under-custom-domain.png" /></p>
Installing SSL
<p>So far, we have been accessing the website under <code>http</code>. If we try <code>https</code>, we are told it is not secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/18-site-under-https-unsafe.png" /></p>
<p>So it’s time to install an SSL certificate provided via <strong>Let’s Encrypt</strong>. For this, we need to log in to the terminal again and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
</code></pre>

<p>The program will request to input the list of domains for which to create the certificate (so you can add <code>yourdomain.com</code> and <code>www.yourdomain.com</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/19-wordpress-demo-installing-ssl.png" /></p>
<p>The program will then request some more info (including your email) and ask if to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS (it’s recommended to say yes). Once it’s all provided, the certificate will be created.</p>
<p>Now, accessing the site under <code>https</code> works well:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/20-website-under-https-OK.png" /></p>
<p>There’s one final step to do: Change the site URL in WordPress from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code> so that all links in the site point to the secure location, and we avoid the HTTP to HTTPS redirects.</p>
<p>Heading to the General Settings screen in WordPress, we see that both the “WordPress Address (URL)” and “Site Address (URL)” inputs cannot be edited.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/21-wordpress-demo-general-settings.png" /></p>
<p>To modify this configuration, we need to edit the <code>wp-config.php</code> file via the terminal.</p>
<p>Then connect to the terminal again, and execute this command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /opt/bitnami/wordpress/wp-config.php
</code></pre>

<p>The command opens the file in the <code>nano</code> text editor.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/22-editing-wpconfig-php-file-with-nano.png" /></p>
<p>Scroll down until finding this code:</p>
<pre><code>define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/');
define('WP_HOME', 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/');
</code></pre>

<p>And replace it with this code:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/');
define('WP_HOME', 'https://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/');
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLOUDFRONT_FORWARDED_PROTO']) &amp;&amp; $_SERVER['HTTP_CLOUDFRONT_FORWARDED_PROTO'] === 'https') {
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then press Ctrl + O (to save) and Ctrl + X (to exit). Reloading the General Settings screen in WordPress, we see the site URL now uses <code>https</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/23-wordpress-demo-general-settings-update-https.png" /></p>
Modifying The Admin Username
<p>Lightsail sets the admin’s username as <code>user</code>. Because WordPress does not allow modification of the username once registered, if we’d like to modify it, we need to do it directly in the MySQL database.</p>
<p>To do this, execute the following command in the terminal (in this case, updating the username to <code>leo</code>):</p>
<div>
<pre><code>mysql -u root -p$(cat /home/bitnami/bitnami_application_password) -e 'UPDATE wp_users set user_login = "leo" where ID = 1;' bitnami_wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Going to the admin user’s profile, we can see the username has been updated.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/24-updated-admin-username-wordpress-demo.png" /></p>
Storing The Images In An S3 Bucket
<p>When uploading images (or any media asset) to WordPress, these are stored under the server’s folder <code>wp-content/uploads</code> and subsequently served from there.</p>
<p>This is a concern because the server should be considered expendable so that if it crashes and needs to be regenerated, no data will be lost. We can create a <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/understanding-instance-snapshots-in-amazon-lightsail?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">snapshot</a> from the server to backup our data, and that will contain the folder with the images, but only starting from the moment in which the snapshot was taken; any image uploaded afterward would be lost.</p>
<p>Another issue could arise when hosting the site on multiple servers. If our traffic goes up, we can increase the computing power in Lightsail by launching additional servers (accessed behind a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/features/load-balancing/?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">load balancer</a>, and all of them reading/writing to the same <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-databases?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">managed database</a>).</p>
<p>However, images hosted in one server are in that server alone; if a request for that image were handled by a different server, the image would be missing.</p>
<p>The solution is to host the images in an S3 bucket and have the WordPress site serve the images directly from the bucket.</p>
<p>Let’s do that. In Lightsail, head over to the Storage tab and click on “Create bucket.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/25-amazon-lightsail-storage-dashboard.png" /></p>
<p>Lightsail offers the same flat pricing structure for S3 buckets as for EC2 instances: Depending on our storage and transfer needs, we can choose a plan that costs $1, 3, or 5 per month.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/26-amazon-lightsail-choosing-plan-when-creating-bucket.png" /></p>
<p>Make sure to choose the same AWS region as the location for the bucket as you had for the server (to reduce latency when uploading the images).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/27-amazon-lightsail-choosing-location-when-creating-bucket.png" /></p>
<p>Finally, provide a unique name for the bucket, and click on “Create bucket.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/28-bucket-created-amazon-lightsail.png" /></p>
<p>The bucket is now created, but we still need to configure it to update its permissions to make the uploaded assets public.</p>
<p>Click on the bucket name and, under the Permissions tab, select “Individual objects can be made public and read-only.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/29-amazon-lightsail-wordpress-bucket-access-permissions.png" /></p>
<p>Under Resource access, attach the server to the bucket (then we can avoid defining our AWS credentials on the WordPress site).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/30-amazon-lightsail-attaching-instance-to-bucket.png" /></p>
<p>Our Lightsail configuration is done. Next, we need to configure the WordPress site to upload images to the bucket.</p>
<p>This is achieved via <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/">WP Offload Media Lite</a>, a free WordPress plugin that automatically uploads to S3 any asset added to the WordPress Media Library.</p>
<p>Head over to the plugins screen, search for “WP Offload Media Lite for Amazon S3,” and install and activate the plugin from the search results.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/31-wordpress-demo-installing-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>Once activated, head over to <code>Settings &gt; WP Offload Media</code> to configure the plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/32-wordpress-demo-site-settings-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>In the Connection Method section, select “My server is on Amazon Web Services, and I'd like to use IAM Roles,” and save your changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/33-connection-method-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>Next, edit the <code>wp-config.php</code> file via the terminal (as explained earlier), and paste the following code anywhere near the top:</p>
<pre><code>define( 'AS3CF_SETTINGS', serialize( array(
    'provider' =&gt; 'aws',
    'use-server-roles' =&gt; true,
) ) );
</code></pre>

<p>Back to the plugin settings, there is a <code>Storage Provider &gt; Bucket tab</code>, where we must select the bucket we created to host our images.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/34-selecting-bucket-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>On the next screen, we can optionally adjust the permissions to access the assets or click on “Keep Bucket Security As Is,” which will finalize the bucket configuration.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make the plugin always retrieve the assets using HTTPS. In the Delivery Settings tab, select “Force HTTPS” and then “Save Changes.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/35-media-force-https-on.png" /></p>
<p>The plugin settings are now complete. We test it out by going to <code>Media &gt; Add New</code>, uploading an image, and inspecting its file URL. If everything goes well, this should start with the bucket URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/36-wordpress-demo-settings-image-upload-bucket.png" /></p>
Distributing Images Via A CDN
<p>We are almost done configuring the website. There is only one thing left to do: Add a CDN to access the images, so these will be served from a location nearby the user, reducing the latency and improving the overall performance of the site.</p>
<p>For this, head over to the Networking tab and click on “Create distribution.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/37-amazon-lightsail-networking-dashboard-wordpress.png" /></p>
<p>In the Create a distribution screen, choose the bucket as the origin of the distribution. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The image request will be processed by an edge location near the user, which will first retrieve the asset from the bucket, cache it, and serve it from this location from then on.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/38-amazon-lightsail-choosing-origin-CDN-distribution.png" /></p>
<p>The pricing structure is flat. Choose the 50 GB plan at $2.50/month, which is free for the first year.</p>
<p>Then provide a unique name for the distribution, and click on “Create distribution.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/39-amazon-lightsail-creating-CDN-distribution.png" /></p>
<p>The distribution is now created. On the top right, we can visualize the domain from which to access our assets, of shape <code>{subdomain}.cloudfront.net</code> (we can change this to a custom domain under the Custom domains tab).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/40-amazon-lightsail-visualizing-CDN-distribution-doman.png" /></p>
<p>We must modify the settings for <strong>WP Offload Media Lite</strong> to indicate to serve images from the CDN.</p>
<p>For that, head over to the Delivery Settings tab and edit the provider (currently set as Amazon S3).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/41-amazon-lightsail-delivery-settings-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>Choose “Amazon CloudFront” and click on “Save Delivery Provider.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/42-amazon-lightsail-updating-delivery-provider-WP-offload-media-lite.png" /></p>
<p>Now back to the Delivery Settings tab, there is a new section, “Use Custom Domain Name (CNAME).” Paste there the distribution domain, and click on “Save Changes.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/43-amazon-lightsail-updating-distribution-doman-wordpress-settings.png" /></p>
<p>To test it out, go once again to <code>Media &gt; Add New</code>, upload an image, and check that the file URL now starts with the distribution domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/44-wordpress-site-settings-validating-image-served-from-CDN.png" /></p>
<p>Success! Accessing our WordPress site will now have its assets served by the AWS CDN, greatly increasing the performance of the site.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/wordpress-site-hosted-by-amazon-lightsail/45-wordpress-blog-post-with-image.png" /></p>
We’re Done Here, Now It’s Your Turn
<p>Lightsail provides all the power we need to host our websites, as we are used to from AWS, but making it way easier than ever before. In this article, we saw how to launch a WordPress site quickly and easily (the whole process took me between 15 and 30 minutes).</p>
<p>Lightsail conveniently offers a flat pricing structure that takes all surprises away from our bills. And you can try it without spending a penny: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?trk=7cac8a80-652f-40a3-9cf6-634bd78a89a2&amp;sc_channel=el">it’s free for the first three months</a>.

On “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/11/whats-new-nextjs-13/">What’s New in Next.js 13</a>?” we have covered the release announced and established that though carrying some interesting experiments, Next.js 13 is definitely stable. And since then, most of us have seen a very clear landscape when it comes to the new <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> components, and even the (still beta) <code>@next/font</code>; these are all good to go, instant profit. <strong>Turbopack</strong>, as clearly stated in the announcement, is still alpha: aimed strictly for <strong>development</strong> builds and still heavily under development. Whether you can or can’t use it in your daily routine depends on your stack, as there are integrations and optimizations still somewhere on the way. This article’s scope is strictly about the main character of the announcement: the new App Directory architecture (AppDir, for short).</p>
<p>Because the <strong>App directory</strong> is the one that keeps bringing questions due to it being partnered with an important evolution in the React ecosystem — React Server Components — and with edge runtimes. It clearly is the shape of the future of our Next.js apps. It is <strong>experimental</strong> though, and its <a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap">roadmap</a> is not something we can consider will be done in the next few weeks. So, should you use it in production now? What advantages can you get out of it, and what are the pitfalls you may find yourself climbing out of? As always, the answer in software development is the same: it depends.</p>
What Is The App Directory Anyway?
<p>It is the new strategy for handling routes and rendering views in Next.js. It is made possible by a couple of different features tied together, and it is built to make the most out of React concurrent features (yes, we are talking about React Suspense). It brings, though, a big paradigm shift in how you think about components and pages in a Next.js app. This new way of building your app has <strong>a lot</strong> of very welcomed improvements to your architecture. Here’s a short, non-exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partial Routing.<ul>
<li>Route Groups.</li>
<li>Parallel Routes.</li>
<li>Intercepting Routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Server Components vs. Client Components.</li>
<li>Suspense Boundaries.</li>
<li>And much more, check the <a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs#features-overview">features overview</a> in the new documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Quick Comparison</h3>
<p>When it comes to the current routing and rendering architecture (in the Pages directory), developers were required to think of data fetching per route.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getServerSideProps</code>: Server-Side Rendered;</li>
<li><code>getStaticProps</code>: Server-Side Pre-Rendered and/or Incremental Static Regeneration;</li>
<li><code>getStaticPaths</code> + <code>getStaticProps</code>: Server-Side Pre-Rendered or Static Site Generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, it hadn’t yet been possible to choose the rendering strategy on a per-page basis. Most apps were either going full Server-Side Rendering or full Static Site Generation. Next.js created enough abstractions that made it a standard to think of routes individually within its architecture.</p>
<p>Once the app reaches the browser, hydration kicks in, and it’s possible to have routes collectively sharing data by wrapping our <code>_app</code> component in a React Context Provider. This gave us tools to <em>hoist</em> data to the top of our rendering tree and cascade it down toward the leaves of our app.</p>
<pre><code>import { type AppProps } from 'next/app';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
        &lt;SomeProvider&gt;
            &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;
        &lt;/SomeProvider&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to render and organize required data per route made this approach an almost good tool for when data absolutely needed to be available globally in the app. And while this strategy will allow data to spread throughout the app, wrapping everything in a Context Provider bundles hydration to the root of your app. It is not possible anymore to render any branches on that tree (any route within that Provider context) on the server. </p>
<p>Here, enters the <strong>Layout Pattern</strong>. By creating wrappers around pages, we could opt in or out of rendering strategies per route again instead of doing it once with an app-wide decision. Read more on how to manage states in the Pages Directory on the article “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/state-management-nextjs/">State Management in Next.js</a>” and on the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts">Next.js documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Layout Pattern</strong> proved to be a great solution. Being able to granularly define rendering strategies is a very welcomed feature. So the App directory comes in to put the layout pattern front and center. As a first-class citizen of Next.js architecture, it enables enormous improvements in terms of performance, security, and data handling.</p>
<p>With React concurrent features, it’s now possible to stream components to the browser and let each one handle its own data. So rendering strategy is even more granular now — instead of page-wide, it’s component-based. Layouts are nested by default, which makes it more clear to the developer what impacts each page based on the file-system architecture. And on top of all that, it is mandatory to explicitly turn a component client-side (via the “use client” directive) in order to use a Context.</p>
Building Blocks Of The App Directory
<p>This architecture is built around the <strong>Layout Per Page Architecture</strong>. Now, there is no <code>_app</code>, neither is there a <code>_document</code> component. They have both been replaced by the root <code>layout.jsx</code> component. As you would expect, that’s a special layout that will wrap up your entire application.</p>
<pre><code>export function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                {children}
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>root layout</strong> is our way to manipulate the HTML returned by the server to the entire app at once. It is a server component, and it <strong>does not</strong> render again upon navigation. This means any data or state in a layout will persist throughout the lifecycle of the app. </p>
<p>While the <strong>root layout</strong> is a special component for our entire app, we can also have root components for other building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>loading.jsx</code>: to define the Suspense Boundary of an entire route;</li>
<li><code>error.jsx</code>: to define the Error Boundary of our entire route;</li>
<li><code>template.jsx</code>: similar to the layout, but re-renders on every navigation. Especially useful to handle state between routes, such as in or out transitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those components and conventions are <strong>nested by default</strong>. This means that <code>/about</code> will be nested within the wrappers of <code>/</code>  automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, we are also required to have a <code>page.jsx</code> for every route as it will define the main component to render for that URL segment (as known as the place you put your components!). These are obviously not nested by default and will only show in our DOM when there’s an exact match to the URL segment they correspond to.</p>
<p>There is much more to the architecture (and even more coming!), but this should be enough to get your mental model right before considering migrating from the <strong>Pages directory</strong> to the <strong>App directory</strong> in production. Make sure to check on the official <a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Server Components In A Nutshell</h3>
<p>React Server Components allow the app to leverage infrastructure towards better performance and overall user experience. For example, the immediate improvement is on bundle size since RSC won’t carry over their dependencies to the final bundle. Because they’re rendered in the server, any kind of parsing, formatting, or component library will remain on the server code. Secondly, thanks to their asynchronous nature, Server Components are <strong>streamed</strong> to the client. This allows the rendered HTML to be progressively enhanced on the browser.</p>
<p>So, Server Components lead to a more predictable, cacheable, and constant size of your final bundle breaking the linear correlation between app size and bundle size. This immediately puts RSC as a best practice versus traditional React components (which are now referred to as client components to ease disambiguation).</p>
<p>On Server Components, fetching data is also quite flexible and, in my opinion, feels closer to vanilla JavaScript — which always smooths the learning curve. For example, understanding the JavaScript runtime makes it possible to define data-fetching as either parallel or sequential and thus have more fine-grained control on the resource loading waterfall.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel Data Fetching</strong>, waiting for all:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>import TodoList from './todo-list'

async function getUser(userId) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/user/${userId}`);
  return res.json()
}

async function getTodos(userId) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/todos/${userId}/list`);
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({ params: { userId } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel.
  const userResponse = getUser(userId)
  const  = getTodos(username)

  // Wait for the promises to resolve.
  const [user, todos] = await Promise.all([userResponse, todosResponse])

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{user.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;TodoList list={todos}&gt;&lt;/TodoList&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel</strong>, waiting for one request, streaming the other:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>async function getUser(userId) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/user/${userId}`);
  return res.json()
}

async function getTodos(userId) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/todos/${userId}/list`);
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({ params: { userId } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel.
  const userResponse = getUser(userId)
  const todosResponse = getTodos(userId)

  // Wait only for the user.
  const user = await userResponse

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{user.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Fetching todos...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
          &lt;TodoList listPromise={todosResponse}&gt;&lt;/TodoList&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

async function TodoList ({ listPromise }) {
  // Wait for the album's promise to resolve.
  const todos = await listPromise;

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {todos.map(({ id, name }) =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={id}&gt;{name}&lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>&lt;TodoList&gt;</code> receives an in-flight Promise and needs to <code>await</code> it before rendering. The app will render the <strong>suspense fallback</strong> component until it’s all done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequential Data Fetching</strong> fires one request at a time and awaits for each:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>async function getUser(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/user/${userId}`);
  return res.json()
}

async function getTodos(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://&lt;some-api&gt;/todos/${userId}/list`);
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({ params: { userId } }) {
  const user = await getUser(userId)


  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{user.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Fetching todos...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
            &lt;TodoList userId={userId} /&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

async function TodoList ({ userId }) {
  const todos = await getTodos(userId);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {todos.map(({ id, name }) =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={id}&gt;{name}&lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>Page</code> will fetch and wait on <code>getUser</code>, then it will start rendering. Once it reaches <code>&lt;TodoList&gt;</code>, it will fetch and wait on <code>getTodos</code>. This is still more granular than what we are used to it with the Pages directory.</p>
<p>Important things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests fired within the same component scope will be fired in parallel (more about this at <a href="#extended-fetch-api">Extended Fetch API</a> below).</li>
<li>Same requests fired within the same server runtime will be deduplicated (only one is actually happening, the one with the shortest cache expiration).</li>
<li>For requests that won’t use <code>fetch</code> (such as third-party libraries like SDKs, ORMs, or database clients), route caching will not be affected unless manually configured via <a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/fetching#segment-cache-configuration">segment cache configuration</a>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>export const revalidate = 600; // revalidate every 10 minutes

export default function Contributors({
  params
}: {
  params: { projectId: string };
}) {
    const { projectId }  = params
    const { contributors } = await myORM.db.workspace.project({ id: projectId })

  return &lt;ul&gt;{*/ ... */}&lt;/ul&gt;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To point out how much more control this gives developers: when within the pages directory, rendering would be blocked until all data is available. When using <code>getServerSideProps</code>, the user would still see the loading spinner until data for the entire route is available. To mimic this behavior in the App directory, the fetch requests would need to happen in the <code>layout.tsx</code> for that route, so always avoid doing it. An “all or nothing” approach is rarely what you need, and it leads to worse perceived performance as opposed to this granular strategy.</p>
Extended Fetch API
<p>The syntax remains the same: <code>fetch(route, options)</code>. But according to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Web Fetch Spec</a>, the <code>options.cache</code> will determine how this API will interact with the <strong>browser cache.</strong> But in Next.js, it will interact with the <a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/fundamentals#caching-data">framework server-side HTTP Cache</a>. </p>
<p>When it comes to the extended <strong>Fetch API</strong> for Next.js and its cache policy, two values are important to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>force-cache</code>: the default, looks for a fresh match and returns it.</li>
<li><code>no-store</code> or <code>no-cache</code>: fetches from the remote server on every request.</li>
<li><code>next.revalidate</code>: the same syntax as ISR, sets a hard threshold to consider the resource fresh.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>fetch(`https://route`, { cache: 'force-cache', next: { revalidate: 60 } })
</code></pre>

<p>The caching strategy allows us to categorize our requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Data</strong>: persist longer. E.g., blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Data:</strong> changes often and/or is a result of user interaction. E.g., comments section, shopping cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, every data is considered <strong>static data</strong>. This is due to the fact <code>force-cache</code> is the default caching strategy. To opt out of it for fully dynamic data, it’s possible to define <code>no-store</code> or <code>no-cache</code>.</p>
<p>If a dynamic function is used (e.g., setting cookies or headers), the default will switch from <code>force-cache</code> to <code>no-store</code>!</p>
<p>Finally, to implement something more similar to Incremental Static Regeneration, you’ll need to use <code>next.revalidate</code>. With the benefit that instead of being defined for the entire route, it only defines the component it’s a part of.</p>
Migrating From Pages To App
<p>Porting logic from <strong>Pages directory</strong> to <strong>Apps directory</strong> may look like a lot of work, but Next.js has worked prepared to allow both architectures to coexist, and thus <strong>migration can be done incrementally</strong>. Additionally, there is a very good <strong><a href="https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/upgrade-guide#migrating-from-pages-to-app">migration guide</a></strong> in the documentation; I recommend you to read it fully before jumping into a refactoring. </p>
<p>Guiding you through the migration path is beyond the scope of this article and would make it redundant to the docs. Alternatively, in order to add value on top of what the official documentation offers, I will try to provide insight into the friction points my experience suggests you will find.</p>
<h3>The Case Of React Context</h3>
<p>In order to provide all the benefits mentioned above in this article, RSC can’t be interactive, which means they don’t have hooks. Because of that, we have decided to push our client-side logic to the leaves of our rendering tree as late as possible; once you add interactiveness, children of that component will be client-side. </p>
<p>In a few cases pushing some components will not be possible (especially if some key functionality depends on React Context, for example). Because most libraries are prepared to defend their users against Prop Drilling, many create context providers to skip components from root to distant descendants. So ditching React Context entirely may cause some external libraries not to work well.</p>
<p>As a temporary solution, there is an escape hatch to it. A client-side wrapper for our providers:</p>
<pre><code>// /providers.jsx
‘use client’

import { type ReactNode, createContext } from 'react';

const SomeContext = createContext();

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    &lt;SomeContext.Provider value="data"&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/SomeContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>And so the layout component will not complain about skipping a client component from rendering. </p>
<pre><code>// app/.../layout.jsx
import { type ReactNode } from 'react';
import Providers from ‘./providers’;

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
    return (
    &lt;Providers&gt;{children}&lt;/Providers&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to realize that once you do this, the entire branch will become client-side rendered. This approach will take everything within the <code>&lt;Providers&gt;</code> component to not be rendered on the server, so use it only as a last resort.</p>
<h3>TypeScript And Async React Elements</h3>
<p>When using <code>async/await</code> outside of Layouts and Pages, TypeScript will yield an error based on the response type it expects to match its JSX definitions. It is supported and will still work in runtime, but according to Next.js documentation, this needs to be fixed upstream in TypeScript.</p>
<p>For now, the solution is to add a comment in the above line <code>{/* @ts-expect-error Server Component */}</code>.</p>
<h3>Client-side Fetch On The Works</h3>
<p>Historically, Next.js has not had a built-in data mutation story. Requests being fired from the client side were at the developer’s own discretion to figure out. With React Server Components, this is bound for a chance; the React team is working on a <code>use</code> hook which will accept a <code>Promise</code>, then it will handle the promise and return the value directly.</p>
<p>In the future, this will supplant most bad cases of <code>useEffect</code> in the wild (more on that in the excellent talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGzanfKVFeU">Goodbye UseEffect</a>”) and possibly be the standard for handling asynchronicity (fetching included) in client-side React. </p>
<p>For the time being, it is still recommended to rely on libraries like React-Query and SWR for your client-side fetching needs. Be especially aware of the <code>fetch</code> behavior, though!</p>
So, Is It Ready?
<p>Experimenting is at the essence of moving forward, and we can’t make a nice omelet without breaking eggs. I hope this article has helped you answer this question for your own specific use case.</p>
<p>If on a greenfield project, I’d possibly take <strong>App directory</strong> for a spin and keep <strong>Page directory</strong> as a fallback or for the functionality that is critical for business. If refactoring, it would depend on how much client-side fetching I have. Few: do it; many: probably wait for the full story.</p>

Plants
<p>“I wanted to draw some very cozy place, both realistic and cartoonish, filled with little details. A space with a slightly unreal atmosphere that some great shops or cafes have. A mix of plants, books, bottles, and shelves seemed like a perfect fit. I must admit it took longer to draw than most of my other pictures! But it was totally worth it. <a href="https://vlad.studio/wallpaper/plants">Watch the making-of</a>.” — Designed by <a href="https://vlad.studio/">Vlad Gerasimov</a> from Georgia.</p>

Love Is In The Air
<p>“February comes with Valentine’s vibes. Valentine’s week begins on February 7 which is celebrated as Rose Day and lasts until the most important day, Valentine’s Day, on February 14. This week, from the 7th to the 14th is likewise called the Love Week, Valentine’s Week, or the Romance Week. So I decided to design this wallpaper to remind everyone to enjoy the loving vibes throughout this week.” — Designed by <a href="https://itobuz.com/">Hrishikesh Shome</a> from India.</p>

Farewell C/2022 E3 ZTF
<p>“On February 1, the recently discovered comet C/2022 E3 ZTF is at its nearest position to Earth.

Farewell little comet!” — Designed by <a href="https://www.philippebrouard.fr">Philippe Brouard</a> from France.</p>

<p></p><h3>“Greben” Icebreaker</h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>“Danube is Europe’s second largest river, connecting ten different countries. In these cold days, when ice paralyzes rivers and closes waterways, a small but brave icebreaker called Greben (Serbian word for ‘reef’) seems stronger than winter. It cuts through the ice on Đerdap gorge (Iron Gate) – the longest and biggest gorge in Europe – thus helping the production of electricity in the power plant. This is our way to give thanks to Greben!” — Designed by <a href="https://www.popwebdesign.net/index_eng.html">PopArt Studio</a> from Serbia.</p><p></p>

<p>Perhaps this is a controversial statement, but I hate it when UI and UX designers are referred to interchangeably. To my mind, at least, they are different roles, with the clue being in the names.</p>
<p>User Interface designers design the interface, while User Experience designers are concerned with the entirety of the user’s experience.</p>
<p>In most cases, that experience extends beyond a single interface, encompassing many touchpoints, both online and off. Nowhere is this more evident than in a business-to-business experience.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to explore some of the unique characteristics of a B2B sales experience and, hopefully, highlight how a UX designer would consider the entirety of the experience, not just the interface elements.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by exploring what makes B2B sales experiences an interesting challenge for us as UX designers.</p>
Why B2B Is An Interesting UX Challenge
<p>Although we must be wary of generalizing, in many cases, B2B experiences are more complicated than B2C.</p>
<p>This complexity is born out of the nature of B2B. Transactions between businesses tend to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher in value.</li>
<li>Involve more stakeholders.</li>
<li>Take longer.</li>
<li>Involve more interactions between parties.</li>
<li>More highly regulated.</li>
<li>Often include more complex products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take, for example, one of my enterprise clients. It is not uncommon for months to pass from them initially getting in touch about a project to me starting work.</p>
<p>Over that time, they may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>read one of my articles or heard me speak,</li>
<li>viewed my website,</li>
<li>reached out on LinkedIn,</li>
<li>exchanged countless emails,</li>
<li>spoken over Zoom,</li>
<li>read my proposal,</li>
<li>signed a contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above works together to shape the client’s experience, not to mention everything I do once work on their project begins.</p>
<p>While a UI designer may work on some of the above touchpoints, a UX designer cares about all of them and how they work collectively together to shape the experience.</p>
<p>With so many potential interactions in a B2B sales journey over an extended period, it is vital to have a clear picture of how they fit together. That is why <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/all-about-customer-journey-mapping/">journey mapping</a> is so popular among UX designers.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/b2b-sales-understand-role-ux-designers-better/1-digital-experience-journey-customer-mapping.jpg" /></p>
Map The Customer Journey
<p>Even if a client commissions me to address a part of a B2B experience, I still favor starting with journey mapping (if they haven’t done so already). Understanding where a particular touchpoint fits into the bigger picture is essential for success.</p>
<p>For example, I work a lot on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/landing-page-design/">optimizing the conversion rate of landing pages</a>. Where users have come from is a significant factor in ensuring the success of that landing page. For example, traffic that comes from ads will have different expectations from those that come from organic search.</p>
<p>I care equally about what the user will do next. Any landing page has to prepare the user for that experience. For example, if salespeople contact every lead and users are not expecting that call, this will lower their conversion rate on those calls.</p>
<p>Understanding where in their journey a user also helps me to tailor appropriate messaging and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/call-to-action-buttons-examples-and-best-practices/">calls to action</a>. Get this wrong, and the experience falls apart. Mapping a journey is an excellent way of designing a <a href="https://boagworld.com/marketing/user-centric-sales-funnel/">sales funnel</a> that gently nudges the user through the process without undermining the experience.</p>
Decide On Calls To Action And Relevant Touchpoints
<p>Have you ever visited a website that immediately displays an overlay when you arrive for the first time? Typically, they offer you a discount in return for signing up for their mailing list. The problem is that you haven’t seen their products yet, so you don’t know if you want the discount. This results in a poor conversion rate and a bad experience that alienates users.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/b2b-sales-understand-role-ux-designers-better/2-user-discount-products-hidden.png" /></p>
<p>If they displayed the overlay for returning visitors or showed it after they had time to look around the site, it would fit better into the journey. Doing so would increase conversion and leave the user feeling more positive about the experience.</p>
<p>A journey map doesn’t just show where to place a call to action. It also helps you shape the journey itself. For example, a typical B2B sales journey might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discover an organizational need.</li>
<li>Research potential suppliers who could fulfill that need.</li>
<li>Shortlist suppliers.</li>
<li>Pick a preferred supplier.</li>
<li>Sign contracts.</li>
<li>Start work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you understand that journey, you can start shaping the experience so that each stage is optimized, helping the user progress to the next stage. Knowing the stages in the funnel helps you identify the appropriate touchpoints, messaging, and calls to action.</p>
<p>For example, I use posts like this one, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/guide-attracting-clients-agency/">speaking slots, and organic search to reach prospective clients who are just discovering they might need help</a>. This is not the moment for a hard sell but rather a chance to help them discover potential solutions to their need.</p>
<p>Often, my call to action at this early stage is to encourage them to <a href="https://boagworld.com/subscribe/">subscribe to my mailing list</a> to get more help. That allows me to nurture the relationship until they start looking for potential suppliers.</p>
<p>This is because there can often be a long gap between first discovering a need and securing a budget to find a supplier. It would be easy for them to forget me, and that lead would be lost.</p>
<p>This brings me to another crucial area that a UX designer needs to consider in the user journey: the gaps in the experience.</p>
Mind The Gap
<p>The user experience is not just about the touchpoints (website, email, etc.), but also about the gaps between these interactions. Gaps can be caused by time passing, switching channels, changing devices, or moving between business silos. These are dangerous moments when customers can easily be “dropped,” their experience undermined, and a sale lost. That’s why companies such as Gong.io use <a href="https://www.gong.io/pipeline-management-software/">sales pipeline software</a> and customer relationship management apps to ensure leads are not lost but instead nurtured over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/b2b-sales-understand-role-ux-designers-better/3-sales-pipeline-software-CRM.jpg" /></p>
<p>But you still see examples of customers falling between these gaps all the time. Every time you’re put on hold while being transferred to another department, you have fallen into a gap. Or when you switch from a mobile device to your laptop to complete filling in a form, only to discover that all of your data has been lost and you have to start again.</p>
<p>A great UX designer will constantly be looking for these gaps to plug. For example, my banking app recently updated so that I no longer need to go through security to identify myself when I call them from the app. After all, I had already identified myself when I logged into the app, so why do I need to do so again on the call? That was a gap between systems that they had successfully plugged.</p>
<p>But while we strive as UX designers to plug gaps and design effortless digital experiences, there is one area we often overlook: human interactions.</p>
Don’t Forget The Human Factor
<p>At this point, you could argue we are <a href="https://boagworld.com/usability/what-is-ux-design/">straying into the realm of Customer Experience Design rather than User Experience</a>, but it is still worth mentioning.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/b2b-sales-understand-role-ux-designers-better/4-user-experience-design-customer-interface-UX.png" /></p>
<p>Throughout a customer journey (particularly in B2B), there will be interactions that are primarily between two people rather than a human and an interface. These interactions may use digital technology (such as webinars, Zoom meetings, emails, or chat) but are essentially one person speaking to another.</p>
<p>The B2B sales journey beautifully demonstrates these issues, as it has many digital communications between people.</p>
<p>As UX designers, we don’t have the luxury of ignoring these interactions, as they are crucial in shaping the user’s experience and the chance of a lead converting. For example, we have all had a frustrating experience with customer support teams who have emailed or messaged us a stock answer that fails to really address our question. Equally, we have encountered salespeople who have pushed too hard for a sale too early in our buying journey. And, of course, we have all read messages from organizations that have come across as impersonal, rude, or insensitive.</p>
<p>Technology makes these interactions feel worse, as we often cannot see or hear the person we are communicating with. Therefore, it falls to those of us seeking to improve the user experience to do at least something to try and mitigate these problems. That might be as simple as suggesting their sales team downloads a <a href="https://www.gong.io/content/sales-coaching-template/">sales coaching plan template</a> or something more ambitious, like running a workshop on how to communicate online better.</p>
<p>At this point, you might think all of this is way outside of your job description. But is it really?</p>
Is This Outside Your Job Description?
<p>We come full circle to where I started this article by saying that the role of UX designer is often mistaken for simply a more senior UI designer. It is not, and in fact, to suggest so is insulting to those who choose to specialize in UI.</p>
<p>If you have been hired as a UX designer and yet spend all of your time creating wireframes for websites, apps, and other interfaces, I would suggest your organization or clients are failing to utilize you to the full.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to break out of the box into which they have put you and start to look at the entire end-to-end user experience. Only then will you be fulfilling the role for which you have been hired.</p>
<p>It won’t happen overnight, and there will be some who would prefer to limit your role, but you cannot improve the user experience without considering the entirety of the journey.</p>

They can be scaled up or down without loss of quality due to their vector properties. They can be compressed and optimized due to the XML format. They can also be easily edited, styled, animated, and changed programmatically.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, SVG is a <strong>markup language</strong>. And just as we can use CSS and JavaScript to enhance our HTML, we can use them the same on SVGs. We could add <strong>character and flourishes</strong> to our graphic elements, add <strong>interactions</strong>, and shape truly delightful and memorable user experiences. This optional but crucial detail is often overlooked when building projects, so <strong>SVGs end up somewhat underutilized</strong> beyond their basic graphical use cases.</p>
<p>How can we even <strong>utilize SVGs</strong> beyond just using them statically in our projects?</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://2021.stateofcss.com/en-US/">“The State of CSS 2021”</a> landing page, for example. This SVG Logo has been beautifully designed and animated by <a href="https://chriskirknielsen.com/">Christopher Kirk-Nielsen</a>. Although this logo would have looked alright just as a static image, it wouldn’t have had as much of an impact and drawn attention without this intricate animation.</p>
<p>Let’s go even further — SVG, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined and used to create <strong>delightful, interactive, and stunning projects</strong>. Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo">Sarah Drasner’s</a> incredible work. She has also written <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/svg-animations/9781491939697/">a book</a> and has a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svg-essentials-animation/">video course</a> on the topic.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/01-star-icon.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s add it to our HTML and create a simple button component.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>&lt;button type="button"&gt;
  &lt;svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 80 80" fill="none" xmlns="<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</a> aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path d="..." fill="#C2CCDE" /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
  Add to favorites
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Our button already has some background and text color styles applied to it so let’s see what happens when we add our SVG star icon to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/02-button-star-icon.png" /></p>
<p>Our SVG icon has a <code>fill</code> property applied to it, more specifically, a <code>fill="#C2CCDE"</code> in SVG’s <code>path</code> element. This icon could have come from the SVG library or even exported from a design file, so it makes sense for a color to be exported alongside other graphical properties.</p>
<p>SVG elements can be targeted by CSS like any HTML element, so developers usually reach for the CSS and override the <code>fill</code> color.</p>
<pre><code>.button svg * {
  fill: var(--color-text);
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/03-button-color-star-icon.png" /></p>
<p>However, this is not an ideal solution as this is a greedy selector, and overriding the <code>fill</code> attribute on all elements can have unintended consequences, depending on the SVG markup. Also, <code>fill</code> is not the only property that affects the element’s color.</p>
<p>Let’s showcase this downside by creating a new button and adding a Google logo icon. SVG markup is a bit more complex than our star icon, as it has multiple <code>path</code> elements. SVG elements don’t have to be all visible, there are cases when we want to use them in different ways (as a clipping region, for example), but we won’t go into that. Just keep in mind that greedy selectors that target SVG elements and override their <code>fill</code>  properties can produce unexpected results.</p>
<div>
<pre><code> &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" xmlns="<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</a> height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"&gt;
  &lt;path d="..." fill="#4285F4" /&gt;
  &lt;path d="..." fill="#34A853" /&gt;
  &lt;path d="..." fill="#FBBC05" /&gt;
  &lt;path d="..." fill="#EA4335" /&gt;
  &lt;path d="..." fill="none" /&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/04-button-visible-svg-element.png" /></p>
<p>We can look at the issue from a different perspective. Instead of looking for a silver bullet CSS solution, we can simply edit our SVG. We already know that the <code>fill</code> property affects the SVG element’s color so let’s see what we can do to make our icons more customizable.</p>
<p>Let’s use a very underutilized CSS value: <code>currentColor</code>. I’ve talked about this awesome value in one of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/lesser-known-underused-css-features-2022/?ref=sidebar#currentcolor">my previous articles</a>. </p>
<blockquote>Often referred to as “the first CSS variable,” <code>currentColor</code> is a value equal to the element’s <code>color</code> property. It can be used to assign a value equal to the value of the <code>color</code> property to any CSS property which accepts a color value. It forces a CSS property to inherit the value of the <code>color</code> property.</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/05-SVGOMG-tool.png" /></p>
<p>If you are looking for more, CSS-Tricks keeps a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/tools-for-optimizing-svg/">comprehensive list</a> of various SVG optimization tools with plenty of information and articles on the topic.</p>
<h3>Using SVGs With Popular JavaScript-Based Frameworks</h3>
<p>Many popular JavaScript frameworks like React have fully integrated SVG in their toolchains to make the developer experience easier. In React, this could be as simple as importing the SVG as a component, and the toolkit would do all the heavy lifting optimizing it.</p>
<pre><code>import React from 'react';
import {ReactComponent as ReactLogo} from './logo.svg';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;ReactLogo /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
export default App;
</code></pre>

<p>However, as <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/_developit/status/1382838799420514317">Jason Miller</a> and many other developers have noted, including the SVG markup in JSX bloats the JavaScript bundle and makes the SVG less performant as a result. Instead of just having the browser parse and render an SVG, with JSX, we have expensive extra steps added to the browser. Remember, JavaScript is the most expensive Web resource, and by injecting SVG markup into JSX, we’ve made SVG as expensive as well.</p>
<p>One solution would be to create <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol">SVG symbol</a> objects and include them with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use">SVG use</a>. That way, we’ll be defining the SVG icon library in HTML, and we can instantiate it and customize it in React as much as we need to.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 128 128" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;symbol id="myIcon" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"&gt;
      &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;/symbol&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;

&lt;!-- Usage --&gt;
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;use href="#myIcon" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>



Breathing Life Into SVGs
<p>Animating SVGs can be easy and fun. It takes just a few minutes to create some simple and effective animations and interactions. If you are unsure which animation would be ideal for a graphic or should you animate it at all, it’s best to consult with the designer. You can even look for some similar examples and use cases on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/animation">Dribble</a> or other similar websites.</p>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that <strong>animations should be tasteful, add to the overall user experience, and serve some purpose</strong> (draw the user’s attention, for example).</p>
<p>We’ll cover various use cases that you might encounter on your projects. Let’s start with a really sweet example.</p>
<h3>Animating A Cookie Banner</h3>
<p>Some years ago, I was working on a project where a designer made an adorable cookie graphic for an unobtrusive cookie consent popup to make the element more prominent. This cookie graphic was whimsical and a bit different from the general design of the website.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/06-cookie-banner.png" /></p>
<p>I’ve created the element and added the graphic, but when looking at the page as a whole, it felt kind of lifeless, and it didn’t stand out as much as we thought it will. The user needed to accept cookies as the majority of website functionality depended on cookies. We wanted to create an unobtrusive banner that doesn’t block user navigation from the outset, so I decided to animate it to make it more prominent and add a bit of flourish and character.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to create three animations that’ll be applied to the cookie SVG:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and snappy rolling fade-in entry animation;</li>
<li>Repeated wiggle animation with a good amount of delay in between;</li>
<li>Repeating and subtle eye sparkle animation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the final result of the element that we’ll be creating. We’ll cover each animation step by step.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/07-easing-function-simple-single-bounce.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s store it in a CSS variable so that we can reuse it for the repeatable wiggle movement animation.</p>
<pre><code>--transition-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.7, 0.4, 1.65);
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s put everything together, set a duration value and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode">fill-mode</a>, and add the animation to our <code>svg</code> element.</p>
<pre><code>/* Our SVG element */
.cookie-notice__graphic {
  opacity: 0; /* Should not be visible at the start */
  animation: enter 0.8s var(--transition-bounce) forwards;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s check out what we’ve created. It already looks really nice. Notice how the bouncing easing function made a lot of difference to the overall look and feel of the whole element.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/08-easing-function-bouncing-curve.png" /></p>
<pre><code>@keyframes wiggle {
  /* Stands still */
  0% {
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) rotateZ(17deg);
  }
  /* Starts moving */
  45% {
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) rotateZ(17deg);
  }

  /* Pulls back */
  50% {
    transform: translate3d(-10%, 0, 0) rotateZ(8deg);
  }

  /* Moves forward */
  55% {
    transform: translate3d(6%, 0, 0) rotateZ(24deg);
  }

  /* Returns to starting position */
  60% {
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) rotateZ(17deg);
  }

  /* Stands still */
  100% {
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) rotateZ(17deg);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>/* Our SVG element */
.cookie-notice__graphic {
  opacity: 0;
  animation: enter 0.8s var(--transition-bounce) forwards,
    wiggle 6s 3s var(--transition-bounce) infinite;
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/09-browsers-inspect-element-tool.png" /></p>
<p>SVG elements can have a CSS <code>class</code> attribute, so we’ll use that to target them. Let’s add the <code>class</code> attribute to the two <code>path</code> elements that we identified.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;path fill="#351f17" d="..." /&gt;
&lt;path class="cookie__eye" fill="#fff" d="..." /&gt;
&lt;path fill="#351f17" d="..." /&gt;
&lt;path class="cookie__eye" fill="#fff" d="..." /&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We want to make cookie’s eyes sparkle. I got this idea from a music video for a song by <a href="https://youtu.be/-zIxPUPWVq8?t=300">Devin Townsend</a>. You can see the animation play at the 5-minute mark. It just goes to show how <strong>you can find ideas pretty much anywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s just change the scale and opacity. Notice how so far, we’ve relied only on those two attributes for all three animations, which are quite different from each other.</p>
<pre><code>@keyframes sparkle {
  from {
    opacity: 0.95;
    transform: scale(0.95);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We want this animation to repeat without delay. It should be subtle enough to blend in nicely with the graphic and the overall element and not obtrusive for the user. As for the easing function, we’ll do something different. We’ll use <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/easing-functions-css-animations-transitions/#staircase-functions">staircase functions</a> to achieve that quick and snappy transition between the two animation states (our <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> values).</p>
<p>We need to be careful here. <strong>Transform origin is going to be set relative to the parent SVG element’s <code>viewbox</code></strong> and not the element itself. So if we set <code>transform-origin: center center</code>, the transformation will use the center coordinates of the parent SVG and not the <code>path</code> element. We can easily fix that by setting a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-box">transform-box</a> property to <code>fill-box</code>.</p>
<blockquote>The nearest SVG viewport is used as the reference box. If a <code>viewBox</code> attribute is specified for the SVG viewport creating element, the reference box is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system established by the <code>viewBox</code> attribute, and the dimension of the reference box is set to the width and height values of the <code>viewBox</code> attribute.</blockquote>

<div>
<pre><code>.cookie__eye {
  animation: sparkle 0.15s 1s steps(2, jump-none) infinite alternate;
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center center;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Last but not least, let’s <a href="https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/">respect the user’s accessibility preferences</a> and turn off all animations if they have it set.</p>
<pre><code>@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  ::before,
  ::after {
    animation-delay: -1ms !important;
    animation-duration: 1ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    background-attachment: initial !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
    transition-duration: 0s !important;
    transition-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the final result. Feel free to play around with the demo and experiment with keyframe values and easing values to change the look and feel of the animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/10-image-text-content-background-svg.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the SVG we’ll be working with. It consists of a few dozen <code>circle</code> elements.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;circle cx="103.5" cy="34.5" r="11.3"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;circle cx="172.5" cy="34.5" r="15.7"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;circle cx="310.5" cy="34.5" r="24.6"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;circle cx="517.5" cy="34.5" r="34.5"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;circle cx="586.5" cy="34.5" r="34.5"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;circle cx="655.5" cy="34.5" r="33.4"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s start by adding a bit of opacity to our background and making it more chaotic. When we apply CSS transforms to elements inside SVG, they are transformed relative to the SVG’s main viewbox. That is why we’re getting a slightly chaotic displacement when applying a <code>scale</code> transform. We’ll use that to our advantage and not change the reference box.</p>
<p>To make things a little bit easier for us, we’ll use SASS. If you are unfamiliar with SASS and SCSS, you can view compiled CSS in CodePen below.</p>
<pre><code>svg circle {
  opacity: 0.85;

  &amp;:nth-child(2n) {
    transform: scale3d(0.75, 0.75, 0.75);
    opacity: 0.3;
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/11-image-sass.png" /></p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s add some keyframes. We’ll use two sets of keyframes that we’ll apply randomly to our circle elements. Once again, we’ll leverage the <code>scale</code> transform displacement and change the opacity value. </p>
<pre><code>@keyframes a {
  0% {
    opacity: 0.8;
    transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0.3;
    transform: scale3d(0.75, 0.75, 0.75);
  }
}

@keyframes b {
  0% {
    transform: scale3d(0.75, 0.75 0.75);
    opacity: 0.3;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0.8;
    transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s use quite a few <code>:nth-child</code> selectors. Every odd child will use the <code>a</code> keyframes, while every even circle will use a <code>b</code> keyframes. We’ll use <code>:nth-child</code> selectors to play around with animation duration and animation delay values.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>svg circle {
  opacity: 0.85;
  animation: a 10s cubic-bezier(0.45,0.05,0.55,0.95) alternate infinite;

  &amp;:nth-child(2n) {
    transform: scale3d(0.75, 0.75, 0.75);
    opacity: 0.3;

    animation-name: b;
    animation-duration: 6s;
    animation-delay: 0.5s;
  }

  &amp;:nth-child(3n) {
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-delay: 0.25s;
  }

  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And, once again, just by playing around with opacity values and CSS transforms on our SVG and playing around with child selectors and animation parameters, we’ve managed to create a more interesting background for our hero container.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/12-design-repeatable-circle-pattern.png" /></p>
<p>Here is a markup for our circle SVG.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns="<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</a> viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;&lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill-opacity=".03"/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Be careful not to inline too much data with base64, so stylesheets can be downloaded and parsed quickly. When we convert it to base64, we get this handy CSS <code>background-image</code> snippet:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>background-image: url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDAgMTAwIj48Y2lyY2xlIGN4PSI1MCIgY3k9IjUwIiByPSI1MCIgZmlsbC1vcGFjaXR5PSIuMDMiLz48L3N2Zz4=);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We can simply apply a simple animation where we offset the <code>background-position</code> by the <code>background-size</code> value and get this neat background animation.</p>
<pre><code>.wrapper {
  animation: move-background 3.5s linear;
  background-image: url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,...);
  background-size: 96px;
  background-color: #16a757;
  /* ... */
}

@keyframes move-background {
  from {
    background-position: 0 0;
  }

  to {
    background-position: 96px 0;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our example looks more interesting with this subtle moving animation going on in the background. Remember to respect users’ accessibility preferences and turn off the animations if they have a preference set.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/13-starting-text.png" /></p>
<p>Before diving into the animation, we need to cover two SVG properties that we’ll be using: <code>stroke-dasharray</code> and <code>stroke-dashoffset</code>. They’re integral for pulling off this animation.</p>
<p>Stroke can be converted to dashes with a certain length using a <code>stroke-dasharray</code> property.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/14-stroke-dasharray-property.png" /></p>
<p>And we can offset the positions of those strokes by a certain amount using the <code>stroke-dashoffset</code> property.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/15-stroke-dashoffset-property.png" /></p>
<p>So, what’s this have to do with our drawing and erasing animation? Imagine what would happen if we could have a dash that covers the whole stroke length and offset it by the same value. In that case, the starting point of the stroke would be way past the ending point of the stroke, and we wouldn’t see it. </p>
<div>
<pre><code>svg path {
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke-linejoin: round;
  stroke-dasharray: 800;  /* Dash covering the whole stroke */
  stroke-dashoffset: 800; /* Offset it to make it invisible */
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we animate the offset value from that value back to 0, the stroke would slowly become visible, <strong>as it was drawing itself</strong>.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>svg path {
  /* ... */
  animation: draw 6s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes draw{
  to {
    stroke-dashoffset: 0; /* Reduce offset to make it visible */
  }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we continue to animate the offset value from 0 to a negative value, <strong>we’d get the erasing effect</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>svg path {
  /* ... */
  animation: drawAndErase 6s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes drawAndErase {
  to {
    stroke-dashoffset: -800;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You’re probably wondering where the magical <code>800</code> pixel value came from. This value depends on the SVG and the length of the dash needed to cover the whole stroke length. It can be easily guessed, but <a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/">Chris Coyier</a> has a handy function that can do it for you. However, depending on the stroke properties and SVG shape, this function might not always return an ideal value, but it can guide you closer to it.</p>
<p>Check out the complete demo and feel free to play around with values to see how the stroke properties affect the animation. If you are looking for more examples, CodyHouse has covered a <a href="https://codyhouse.co/nuggets/self-drawing-svg-animation">fun-looking button animation</a> using the same trick.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/svg-customization-animation-practical-guide/16-smashing-cat-barista.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s start by adding the <strong>mouse-tracking eye animation</strong>. We’ll skip manually implementing this feature in JavaScript and use a handy library called <a href="https://github.com/jj811208/watching-you">watching-you</a>.</p>
<p>Using the browser’s inspect element tool, we’ll find the target elements inside the SVG and add the eye-left and eye-right CSS classes to these elements, respectively.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>&lt;ellipse class="cls-5 eye eye-left" cx="245.15133" cy="134.57033" rx="5.31264" ry="8.61816" transform="translate(-33.47349 110.5587) rotate(-23.83807)" /&gt;
&lt;ellipse class="cls-4 eye eye-right" cx="284.42686" cy="116.68559" rx="5.31264" ry="8.61816" transform="translate(-22.89477 124.9063) rotate(-23.83807)" /&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We’ll configure the library and make it target the classes that we’ve added.</p>
<pre><code>const optionsLeft = { power: 4, rotatable: false };
const watcherLeft = new WatchingYou(".eye-left", optionsLeft);
watcherLeft.start();

const optionsRight = { power: 3, rotatable: false };
const watcherRight = new WatchingYou(".eye-right", optionsRight);
watcherRight.start();
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to remember to apply the <code>transform-box</code> property, so our eyes move around the center.</p>
<pre><code>.eye {
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center center;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s check out what we’ve got. With just a few lines of code and a tiny JavaScript library to do the heavy lifting, we’ve made the SVG element respond to the mouse position. Now that’s amazing, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Bowtie and hat animation will be created in a very similar way. Let’s start with a hat and find it using the browser’s inspect element tool. The hat graphic consists of two path elements, so let’s group them.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;g class="hat"&gt;
  &lt;path class="cls-6" d="..." /&gt;
  &lt;path class="cls-9" d="..." /&gt;
&lt;/g&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll apply the same <code>transform-box</code> property and add a <code>hat--active</code> class that will run the animation when applied.</p>
<pre><code>.hat {
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center bottom;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.hat--active {
  animation: hatJump 1s cubic-bezier(0, 0.7, 0.5, 1.25);
}

@keyframes hatJump {
  0% {
    transform: rotateZ(0) translateY(0);
  }

  50% {
    transform: rotateZ(-10deg) translateY(-50%);
  }

  100% {
    transform: rotateZ(0) translateY(0);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let’s set up a click event listener that applies an active class to the element and then removes it after the animation has finished running.</p>
<pre><code>const hat = document.querySelector(".hat");

hat.addEventListener("click", function () {
  if (hat.classList.contains("hat--active")) {
    return;
  }
  // Add the active class.
  hat.classList.add("hat--active");

  // Remove the active class after 1.2s.
  setTimeout(function () {
    hat.classList.remove("hat--active");
  }, 1200);
});
</code></pre>

<p>We use the same trick with the bowtie element, only applying a different animation and class. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://codepen.io/AdrianBece/pen/gOjgQGw">CodePen demo</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to the coffee machine. Notice we don’t have any SVG element acting as a coffee on our SVG, so we’ll need to add it ourselves. You should <strong>feel comfortable editing SVG markup</strong> and we don’t even have to break a sweat here. Let’s make it easy for ourselves and find and copy the coffee machine’s pipe rectangle, which is similar to the coffee stream shape we want to have. We just have to change the color to brown and slightly adjust the dimensions.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Pipe --&gt;
&lt;rect class="cls-12" x="137.81171" y="243.99883" width="6.21967" height="12.29272" transform="translate(281.84309 500.29037) rotate(-180)" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Copied and adjusted Pipe rect to act as a coffee --&gt;
&lt;rect class="coffee" x="139" y="243.99883" width="4" height="12.29272" transform="translate(281.84309 500.29037) rotate(-180)" fill="brown" /&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Like in the previous examples, let’s add active classes and their respective animation keyframes. We’ll compose the two animations and play around with duration and delay. </p>
<pre><code>.lever, .coffee {
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center bottom;
}

.lever {   
  cursor: pointer; 
}

.lever--active {
  animation: leverPush 2.5s linear;
}

@keyframes leverPush {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  8% {
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }
  90% {
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.coffee--active {
  animation: coffeeStream 2.4s 0.1s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes coffeeStream {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  5% {
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }
  95% {
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(150%);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s apply the active classes on click and remove them after the animation has finished running. And that’s it!</p>
<pre><code>const lever = document.querySelector(".lever");
const coffee = document.querySelector(".coffee");

lever.addEventListener("click", function () {
  if (lever.classList.contains("lever--active")) {
    return;
  }

  lever.classList.add("lever--active");
  coffee.classList.add("coffee--active");

  setTimeout(function () {
    lever.classList.remove("lever--active");
    coffee.classList.remove("coffee--active")
  }, 2500);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the complete example below, and, as always, feel free to play around with the animations and experiment with other elements, like the speech bubble or making the coffee machine’s lights blink while coffee is pouring out. Have fun!</p>

<p>A really great way to build customer relationships is by regularly involving them in user research. However, getting customers involved in user research in the first place can be challenging because they might not understand what you want to do with them, and they’re busy. </p>
<p>Building customer relationships is not always straightforward. It takes work and investment. </p>
<p>In this article, we will go through various ways that product teams can utilize to build relationships with customers.</p>
The Importance Of Customer Relationships
<p>If the growth in the <strong>customer relationship management (CRM)</strong> software market is any indication, businesses see the value in relationship-building with their customers. Gartner estimates that the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/software-market-insights-customer-relationship-management-crm">CRM market will grow over 14% through 2025</a>. In 2021, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4001096">Gartner reported</a> that the CRM market share had grown to $69 billion worldwide. </p>
<p>A CRM tool enables businesses to communicate with their customers in a scalable way. However, true customer relationship management goes beyond a software solution. It involves person-to-person interaction and building trust. Business experts recommend viewing customer relationships as <a href="https://smallbiz.tools/how-to-build-customer-relationships/">long-term relationships</a>. While it’s important to gain new customers, it’s vital to <a href="https://smallbiz.tools/importance-building-customer-relationships/">nurture relationships</a> with your current customers. CRM tools have robust functions to engage customers, from sales and marketing to customer service. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/24/why-is-customer-relationship-management-so-important/?sh=cc0bc5a7dacd">Forbes</a> describes, customer loyalty and retention affect a company’s revenue. A 5% increase in customer retention can produce more than <a href="https://media.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf">a 25% increase in profit</a>.</p>
<p>While it is important to engage with customers in the sales and service stages (e.g., when they need help), engaging with them while they’re using the product is also essential. </p>
<p>More specifically, after a customer has bought your product or service, do you only want to talk to them when they’re having problems? </p>
<p>One way to show that you’re invested in your customers is to bring them into the product development process through <a href="https://groundedinsights.org/complete-guide-to-user-research/">user research</a>, which enables them to provide their input and shape the future of the products that they’re using.</p>
<p>By taking advantage of user research techniques such as user interviews, surveys, <a href="https://groundedinsights.org/starter-guide-to-usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and focus groups, you can uncover valuable data that will help you refine and improve your product while still keeping it aligned with customer expectations. You can ask your customers for feedback on specific aspects of the product and learn how to make it better.</p>
<p>However, in my experience as a user researcher in business-to-business (B2B) companies, I’ve seen that it can be challenging to involve customers in user research if you haven’t done the work upfront to build a relationship with them. Email invitations from CRM tools to participate in user research often go unopened if additional work hasn’t been done to nurture that relationship.</p>
<p>A user research session typically involves a participant having a 1:1 meeting with the researcher. It’s challenging enough to get people to respond to a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/202106/why-customers-hate-participating-in-surveys">quick survey</a>, much less take the time to meet with a person face-to-face. Studies have been done on why <a href="https://www.icf.com/insights/health/declining-survey-response-rate-problem">responses to surveys have declined</a> over the years. One reason cited is trust: participants <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120306653#!">distrust the organization</a> or feel that there’s a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/202106/why-customers-hate-participating-in-surveys">lack of empathy</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to share some tips and tricks from my experience that have helped me nurture customer relationships and build better products that go beyond using the software. </p>
How To Start Building Customer Relationships
<p>While CRM software does an excellent job of managing customer relationships, it <a href="https://magneticonemobile.com/5-reasons-your-salespeople-hate-your-crm-system/">lacks personality</a> because it takes away that personal approach we’ve relied on for decades before the advent of the software. </p>
<p>However, there are many <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15963-benefits-of-crm.html">benefits of using CRM software</a> that help make sure the customers have a better experience with your company. For instance, CRM software can streamline conversations so the marketing and product teams don’t ask the same person the same questions. </p>
<p>I think there’s a middle ground that we can find somewhere. The <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/5-examples-where-the-personal-touch-still-matters-in-marketing/">personal touch still matters</a> because it puts a face to your business, creates emotional bonds, gives you an edge, encourages loyalty, and fosters trust. </p>
<p>To enable a personal touch and be able to elicit product feedback from customers, there are a few different techniques you can try out. Let’s discuss them below. </p>
<h3>Technique #1: Find Champions Within Your Company</h3>
<p>One way to start building a customer relationship is to find other people at your company who already work with the type of customer you are interested in learning from. Their role will likely be different than yours. They might work in sales or customer success. They might not have heard about user research or understand why it’s actually an important way to deepen a customer relationship. Thus, it might seem daunting to find people who are supportive of user research, especially if your job is remote, where there are no casual water cooler conversations.</p>
<p>I recommend starting with your colleagues who work closely with you and helping them understand what you’re trying to accomplish. They might have people and resources they can identify for you that would be a good person to connect with. Don’t be afraid to ask for a personal introduction. </p>
<p>When I first started in my first researcher role, I found it difficult to advocate for the value of the work I did. I was the first researcher my team had ever had before. We had an old-school product manager who thought that the client conversations he had meant that we didn’t need to do additional research. I sought advice from my teammates and read various case studies to look for ways to communicate the value of my work. </p>
<p>Tomer Sharon, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Our-Research-Stakeholder-Buy-/dp/0123851300/"><em>It’s Our Research: Getting Stakeholder Buy-in for User Experience Research Projects</em></a>, writes that “when you work with stakeholders, not on them, everyone stands to gain.” In user research, <a href="https://groundedinsights.org/starter-guide-to-stakeholder-interviews/">stakeholders</a> are those that have a stake in the outcomes of your research. They’re the ones who can act upon your research findings. </p>
<p>A common issue, Sharon writes in his book, is the following:</p>
<blockquote>“Researchers plan a study with their stakeholders, then desert them and run the study by themselves, only to come back to stakeholders a month later expecting them to fix usability problems, change the product roadmaps, or stop a release of a major redesign.”</blockquote>

<p>As much as we want it to, the world does not get put on hold while we conduct our research. The other people on our teams have their own work they’re more worried about than yours. That’s why it’s important to <strong>regularly engage your stakeholders throughout the user research process</strong>. </p>
<p>I started trying out some of the tips from Sharon’s book along with advice from senior researchers at my company and found a huge change in attitude with my teammates.</p>
<p>When planning a research project, involve the right people in the planning of it. A good best practice is to have people from product management, software development, design, and sales there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Product management knows the business goals and priorities. They can help identify the right audience for the product. Product managers also lead development timelines.</li>
<li>Software developers are the ones most influenced by the research results because they have to make code changes based on the findings.</li>
<li>Design is a user researcher’s natural partner in getting things right, and they tend to be great at capturing critical observations.</li>
<li>Sales are in close relationships with customers and might be critical to recruitment. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2cb73390-bc28-4343-aa8e-32d6d6ea3d11/1-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>Finding out what your stakeholders want to know AND what they plan to do with the results are crucial aspects of creating an effective research strategy because then your research is more likely to provide value and be implemented. At the time, one of my senior research colleagues told me to “get three questions from your stakeholders that they want to be answered.” I’ve found that to be a good rule of thumb when trying to gather effective research questions. </p>
<p>In general, don’t expect that your stakeholders will initiate research planning meetings. As the researcher, that’s something you should own. It’s all about working together as a team. Sharon suggests having high-level research planning meetings with a senior product and/or engineering manager once a month or quarter. He suggests you should have more tactical research planning and updates with a product manager or engineering team lead every week or two. In short, <strong>high-level meetings with senior leadership, tactical with the people doing the day-to-day work</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as you initiate meetings with them, you should attend the meetings they hold, such as weekly product management and engineering leadership meetings, so that you have a better idea of where your work can fit in. </p>
<p>I learned that continuous involvement in research = continuous buy-in. Bring in your teammates at the beginning of your research planning. Involve them in all aspects of it. As Sharon wrote, don’t just involve them in planning. I like to bring my stakeholders into my actual research sessions. I put them to work, too. I have them take notes, and then we discuss what we observed afterward. That way, nothing is a surprise to them. </p>
<p>Another effective tactic I first read in Sharon’s book is to <strong>keep research studies small</strong>. The larger and more ambitious the study, the longer it’s going to take. By the time you’ve completed the research project, the team might have moved on to something else. Thus, it’s a good idea to conduct research in a smaller, more agile way. </p>
<p>When you present your research findings to your stakeholders, don’t give them a data dump. As tempting as it might be to show everything you did, they don’t care. They want to know what you found, and if you answered the questions they wanted to know. Your presentation is just the tip of the iceberg. My advisor in college told me that as I was preparing my senior thesis, it crushed my soul at the time. But she was right. To be an effective storyteller, you have to know what to leave out. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/77a0a4f2-81b9-42f4-9f13-a8de8e738f63/2-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>By bringing your colleagues into the research process, you’re giving them firsthand experience of what you’re doing, and you’re giving them ownership of the research itself. </p>
<p>When they’re invested in the outcomes of the research, they understand the need to involve customers in the research. They’ll start to see the value of research. A product manager I worked with started thinking that doing user research would help sell the product to new and existing customers because of how we were able to showcase our redesigned product.</p>
<p>All in all, <strong>building customer relationships also involves building internal company relationships</strong>. One way to do that is to bring your colleagues directly into the research process.</p>
<p>Once you identify the people who can help you build customer relationships, you’ll want to get specific about your request from them. </p>
<h3>Technique #2: Get Specific On What You Want To Request</h3>
<p>A general request of, “I want to talk to this customer about this,” without the details of what you’re planning to do, will confuse the person you’re asking to assist you and thus might appear reluctant to introduce their contact to you especially if you haven’t involved them in your research because you’re still new or they’re not on your immediate team.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to go outside of your immediate network to find colleagues who can connect you with the right participants. </p>
<p>I don’t advise trying to reach out to someone at your company without first developing your research plan. A research plan should include the title of the research project, who’s involved with the project, the date last updated, the background of how the study came about, what goals the study should address, the research questions the project should answer, details about the research method, the target user and the number of participants needed, the schedule, and the script. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/79cd0129-e641-4e61-a09d-a080e394deb8/3-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have a research plan, you should have a clear understanding of what kind of participants you need for your research project. If you need to talk to someone outside of your immediate team that you don’t know very well, you probably don’t want to show them your whole research plan since that’s going to be a lot for someone who isn’t familiar with research to take in. I suggest pulling out the following details from your plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target user</strong>: Who we’re looking to connect with;</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: What’s the goal of the research study;</li>
<li><strong>Research questions</strong>: We plan to ask them these sorts of questions;</li>
<li><strong>Time commitment</strong>: How much time you are asking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting clear on who you want to talk to and why will help your colleague know whether they can help you. Knowing details about what you’re doing with the customer and how long the time commitment is will help them understand how to introduce you to the customer.  </p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten clear on those details, you can also try to share them on internal messaging boards such as Slack. For instance, I’ve made a “one-pager,” or a one-page flier that includes these details and posted them on Slack channels where I can find people with the customer connections I need. For example, our customer success managers have a special Slack channel, so I’ve posted it there.</p>
<p>When making a one-pager, think about making it <strong>as actionable and consumable as possible</strong>. I made the following sample one-pager in Google Slides. I used the basic “title and body” layout to write the title and three bullet points. Then I used the “Explore” feature to make the layout look more engaging. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d4c92f3f-5632-4d06-931f-cbc94813d9b6/4-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>One-pagers like this can be used in other avenues besides Slack. If you’re meeting directly with someone, you can show them the one-pager so they can read it and have a visual to go along with what you’re asking. If a product manager is presenting to customers, you could ask them to include the one-pager at the end of their presentation as a call to action.</p>
<p>Getting specific on what you’re requesting from your colleagues also has the benefit of helping you hone in on your search for customers because it forces you to articulate what you’re looking for. </p>
<p>These first two techniques have looked at how to find internal advocates and assistance to connect with customers. The other tactics involve ways to look externally and find customers directly. </p>
<h3>Technique #3: Discover Where Users Spend Their Time</h3>
<p>You want to try to understand where your customers spend their time. If you don’t know that, how can you expect to reach them? This might mean taking a look at your web analytics to see where people are coming from before they land on your website or product. It might also mean conducting some user research to ask people where they get their information or what kinds of websites and apps they use on a daily basis. This might be hard to do if you have no one to talk to, but once you do, it’s a strategy you can implement to build out your contact list even more.</p>
<p>One of the most reliable places to connect to your product users is to <strong>find a user group or online community specific to your industry or product</strong>. For example, if you make accounting software, there’s a good chance that there’s an online community for people who use QuickBooks. You can go to the forums dedicated to QuickBooks and see what conversations people are having. You might try to directly message people who’ve made helpful comments or try posting on the forum itself. You can also get insights into what these users are thinking and feeling about your product or industry and keep a pulse on what product users are talking about. In addition, use the <a href="https://renaissancerachel.com/crowd-sourcing-user-research-insights-on-a-product-forum/">community forums</a> as a method to do some light research.</p>
<p>The benefit of user groups and online communities is that you can get very specific with who you’re talking.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the IBM Community forum to engage with our customers in the hopes of getting them to sign up for user research sessions. In the example post below, I included a screenshot of the homepage for one of our products and asked what the forum members thought about it. You can view the post <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloudpakfordata/discussion/leveraging-cloud-pak-for-datas-customized-homepage">here</a> and see other questions we asked <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloudpakfordata/search?s=%23InnovationJam&amp;executesearch=true&amp;p=8">here</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c270f508-e31a-472c-b0fa-2aec3ad780e5/5-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>I got a relatively high response rate on this post because it had a visual for them to respond to and was related to a commonly used feature. In certain posts, I included a link to a sign-up page or a survey that participants could take to get extra raffle tickets. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6bc058ce-58e5-48bb-8261-b1813d1dc191/6-building-customer-relationships-user-research.png" /></p>
<p>The raffle tickets were part of how we created an entire event experience on the forum itself to encourage engagement. If you’d like to read more about how to run an entire event on a forum, check out my <a href="https://renaissancerachel.com/crowd-sourcing-user-research-insights-on-a-product-forum/">blog post</a> about it. </p>
<p>You could try doing something similar by posting an image from your product, asking for feedback, and giving a link to sign up to participate in research. If applicable, you could mention the monetary incentive they might receive by participating. </p>
<p>Engaging with customers on a forum is also a nice way to do some <a href="https://tsharon.medium.com/continuous-user-research-in-11-6-seconds-57c27d1595c5">continuous user research</a> and get feedback outside of individual research projects. </p>
<p>It’s hard to write content in forums that doesn’t sound spammy, so it might take some trial and error to figure out what kind of messaging will work for your particular target user group. </p>
<p>To strengthen the personal touch, there are other strategies you can use. We will discuss them below. </p>
<h3>Technique #4: Attend Trade Shows And Conferences</h3>
<p>Trade shows and conferences are great places to meet potential customers. They give you that face-to-face interaction you miss with online communications. A list of upcoming trade shows and conferences can be found by searching online, on social media, or by finding out what events your marketing team plans to go to.</p>
<p>Once you’re at the trade show or conference, be sure to stop by the booths of companies that might be potential customers. Introduce yourself and let them know that you do user research. It’s also a good idea to wear a name tag that has your name and the company you work for. These name tags make it easy for people to find you and start a conversation.</p>
<p>Attending talks and sessions that are relevant to your product or industry is also extremely helpful. I’ve had amazing luck just walking up to a conference speaker after they give a presentation and asking them if they’d like to join our research program. After watching someone give a talk, you know if they might be an articulate participant. </p>
<p>For instance, I was at a user group conference and saw someone give a really helpful presentation on the product I worked on. I knew I’d love to work with him to improve our product, so I introduced myself and asked if he’d be interested in giving product feedback. We exchanged contact information, and he became very engaged in future research activities. </p>
<p>The next time I attended the conference, he told his colleagues about how much he enjoyed participating in research activities and how much that meant to him. It encouraged more interest in our research program.</p>
<p>As you start attracting people to do research with you, you’ll want to find a way to organize and manage your relationship with them.</p>
<h3>Technique #5: Build Your Own Participant Panel</h3>
<p>It might sound daunting, but let’s start small. When you think of participant panels, you might think you need at least a thousand people. While that is a great goal to shoot for, having that many is not necessary to start running research studies.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you have a participant panel when you have connected with just one customer. That customer can connect you with other people at their company or in your network.</p>
<p> Be sure to check your company’s policies around storing personal information and what tools you can use to do that. You don’t want to be in violation of any internal policies. </p>
<p>You might consider using your company’s CRM tool to manage your participant panel, or you might use <a href="https://renaissancerachel.com/panel-management-software/">panel management software</a>, that’s more specific for user research use cases. Panel management software differs from CRM software in that there are dedicated functions to help you screen participants and schedule research sessions. Evaluate what tools you have available and see what your needs are. </p>
<p>For example, your company might use Salesforce as its CRM to manage customer relationships. Salesforce works really well as a marketing, sales, and support tool. It aggregates data from various sources, allowing businesses to have a central source of truth about their customers, giving a complete picture of what’s happening with a customer. </p>
<p>That said, Salesforce does not fully meet the needs of user researchers. While it’s very helpful to see information such as customer browsing behavior, demographic information, and support ticket history, it doesn’t necessarily help a user researcher connect with that participant for a focused research session. </p>
<p>In order to properly run a research study, you have to find the right participants, schedule sessions with them, and, if applicable, have them sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and compensate them for their time. Technically, something like this could be done in a CRM tool, but it would involve more steps than a tool designed to run research. It might be challenging to get your research team to adopt such a complex workflow. </p>
<p>A dedicated panel management tool like User Interviews or Great Question works with CRM software by pulling the relevant data (such as name, job title, demographic information, employment type, and so on) into its platform and allows you to focus on running your research. These tools are designed to have a database of participants you can invite to participate in a study. If you need to send them a screener survey, that capability is built into the tool. You’re able to set a calendar with your availability, and the participant can book a time with you. Document signing and consent forms are built into the process, so you don’t have to worry about data compliance. After a session has been completed, you can distribute monetary incentives to the participants to thank them for their time.</p>
<p>While using a panel management tool might be simpler than a CRM tool for conducting research, it does add another tool to the mix, so that’s where it’s important to evaluate your team’s needs. When there’s another tool with customer data, you’ll have to update two datasets. Does the easier user experience outweigh the possible difficulties of having another dataset? If you’re able to integrate the CRM software with the panel management tool, then you don’t have to worry about keeping data up to date in multiple places. </p>
<p>Once you’ve got a panel, you’ll start having access to potential participants without having to go through gatekeepers or spend time recruiting people.</p>
<p>However, the access to participants only lasts if you maintain those <a href="https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/relationshipops-an-emerging-aspect-of-researchops/">relationships</a>. You’re not done after you recruit them the first time.</p>
<h3>Technique #6: Take The Time To Build Relationships</h3>
<p>Getting to the point where you have easy access to customers can take a lot of work. But just as it is with any relationship, you still need to put in work to maintain customer relationships.</p>
<p>When you get busy with your job, it can be easy to forget the personal touches. You might start reaching out to your customers only when you want to get their feedback on the product. That can start to feel very one-sided. It’s about taking the time to <strong>connect and learn about them as people</strong>.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask them how they’re doing, what they’re working on, and what their weekend was like. Share something about yourself. People love to connect with others around common interests and values. Also, send thank you notes, too! It’s just as crucial in user research as in any other field.</p>
<p>In my practice, I like to send out newsletters to the customers I work with to update them on how we used their feedback to improve the product. Since the value to the customer is seeing the product improve, I tell them about the takeaways from research projects and how we plan to address them. </p>
<p>Remember that you’re playing the long game here. Relationships take time to build, so it requires perseverance and patience. </p>
<h3>Technique #7: Be Patient And Track Your Impact</h3>
<p>Building relationships with customers is key to success in user research. However, it takes time. You might not get immediate results, but if you’re patient and keep at it, you’ll eventually find the people you need to talk to.</p>
<p>You might be surprised that the work you’ve put in now will pay off in huge ways you might not have anticipated six months down the line or even a year or more.</p>
<p>It can take time to get buy-in. The important thing is to keep going!</p>
<p>Be sure to recognize your wins: big or small. Keep track of them and remind yourself of them when you get discouraged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did someone invite you to talk about your customer feedback program at one of their meetings? Yay! That’s huge!</li>
<li>Has one of your stakeholders who’s been difficult to work with in the past asked you for your opinion on something? Congrats!</li>
<li>Did someone sign up for a research study from a community forum post? Amazing work!</li>
</ul>
<p>It may not seem like much at this moment, but over time it truly adds up to a meaningful impact.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>Building customer relationships is vital to user research. These steps will help you get started, but you’ll have to adapt the method to your specific needs.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to be patient and to take the time to connect with people. User research is all about relationships!</p>

There are many features coming to the web that will make creating contrast a lot easier. But even though CSS functions such as <code>color-contrast()</code> are only available in Safari behind a flag, we can already do a lot to create contrast in an easy way by using custom properties.</p>
Good Design For Accessibility Shouldn’t Be Hard
<p>When we design, we think about creating <strong>something beautiful</strong> that enables emotion and can <strong>project the philosophy of a brand</strong>. We want to reach as many people as we can, but there are times we start struggling to find a way to design something accessible while still respecting the look &amp; feel of a brand. While there might not be an easy way to overcome this when it comes to printed design, we can <strong>create better experiences for people on the web</strong> by creating small tweaks to our contrast using CSS. I’m not going to lie to you, this does evolve some careful planning and creating a solid design system, but we can do this! Let’s create a design for everybody’s eyes.</p>
<p>Before we really start to take a deep dive into how we can create such a high-contrast system, let’s debunk some of the myths that are still floating around in the world.</p>
<h3>Myth 1: We Have To Create Two Designs</h3>
<p>With a careful, thought-out design system, it shouldn’t be necessary to create multiple designs in order to create a high-contrast version. All it takes is careful planning of colors and components. While it’s not always possible, you could create high-contrast colors for the brand from the outset. When it comes to the actual design of your components, creating two color definitions in your design system is a good starting point: your primary design colors and high-contrast variants. </p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/1-base-colors-high-contrast-colors.png" /></p>
<p>When creating those different color sets, we should think about our components. Instead of looking at each component individually, we could think about how to replace all of their colors at the same time. Of course, that is the ideal situation, and we might need to specify some components in detail if necessary.</p>
<h3>Myth 2: It Takes Too Much Time</h3>
<p>Ah, the good old myth about accessibility and time management. But let’s keep it real. Creating extra options for high contrast will take a small amount of extra time when it comes to design planning. It’s a bit more work than adding some extra <code>aria</code> attributes (which you should avoid, if possible) or using <code>(r)ems</code> for font sizes. But to be fair, the returns you get for that little extra time could be substantial, especially if you decide to create a design with lighter colors or subtle color palettes.</p>
<h3>Myth 3: Contrast Is Subjective</h3>
<p>While it is true that multiple types of disabilities affect the way a user perceives your website, contrast is a measurable profusion for accessibility. <strong>Getting a triple-A score can be a bit more challenging than going for double-A</strong>. If achieving a triple-A score across your whole website is really too big of a challenge, you could <strong>create a plan</strong> where you make choices based on the importance of the content, creating the highest contrast for the main content and navigation and maybe settle for double-A for less important information. The fact that you are already thinking in those terms shows that you have the right mindset and care about your users. A double score shouldn’t be too hard to achieve, but at least try to go for more.</p>
<p>Taking care of a better contrast is caring for your users. We should always try to achieve the highest contrast possible from the start. Even though there are a few software solutions, such as overlays and even manual solutions (screen adjustment), to help with low contrast, we want to <strong>make a statement</strong> to our users by showing we care. Do we really want our users to visit our website with an external tool? I think we want to give our users the <strong>best experience possible</strong>. And provide the users with something <strong>designed for them</strong>.</p>
<h3>Myth 4: It Wouldn’t Be True To The Branding, Because The Branding Is Low-contrast.</h3>
<p>This is probably the myth that we hear most. But what if we stay true to the branding while also optimizing? If your brand has a low-contrast logo, it’s still better to create an alternative version with high-contrast colors. The reason for this is quite simple: if you want to force people to the low-contrast banding, then you’re just excluding people, and if you are running a webshop, you might potentially lose some sales. We don’t have to just use the colors from the logo, either. You could also add supplementary (high contrast) colors to your palette.</p>
<p>It’s much easier (and cheaper) to create a high-contrast version of your website than to do a complete rebranding. You could even create a high-contrast version of your logo and control the SVG with CSS, which is why in my demo, the logo was slightly altered for low contrast. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about some of the myths about contrast and colors, I suggest you <a href="smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/realities-myths-contrast-color/">read this smashing article by Andrew Somers</a>.</p>
You Can Plan Ahead Or Optimize While Developing
<p>In the first part of this article, we chose to plan ahead and already create a design system that handles the low-contrast colors. But we all have deadlines and might not find the time to create something like this. So what can we do to adjust our colors for low contrast when we don’t have the plan to start with? Before we set off, let’s start with our basic design; I made a “cupcake factory” with light colors to illustrate contrast issues:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/2-cupcake-factory-website-example.png" /></p>
<p>As the title of this article stated, we used custom properties to set our basic colors inside the root of our website.</p>
<pre><code>:root {
    --color-champagne: #EFD9CE;
    --color-tiffany: #07BEB8;
    --color-blizzard: #98DFEA;
    --color-plum: #8F3985;
    --color-space: #25283D;
    --color-lightest: #FAFAFA;
    --color-logo-basket: #F8E6C4;
    --color-logo-topping: #FF89C0;
}
</code></pre>

Our Initial Styling Using Custom Properties
<p>We’re going to use these custom properties to color our website. In reality, we would use custom properties for a lot more than the colors, but to keep this demo to the point, let’s keep this to a minimum.</p>
<p>For example, our coloring would be something like this (stripping all other properties):</p>
<pre><code>body {
    background: var(--color-champagne);
    color: var(--color-space);
}

h2 {
    color: var(--color-plum);
}

header {
    background: var(--color-plum);
}


.branding {
    color: var(--color-champagne);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We will be overwriting these colors later on by using the media query that detects if the user prefers more contrast:</p>
<pre><code>@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
    /* overwrites here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>This media query is available in all of the evergreen browsers.</p>
<h3>A Small Note On The <code>prefers-contrast</code> Media Query</h3>
<p>It’s always a better practice not to rely on this media query. There are many users out there who struggle with low contrast that haven’t had any education about high contrast system settings. We are now assuming that we don’t have any choice but to use low-contrast color combinations and therefore want to implement some improvements for the people who actually know these settings. However, do not completely underestimate the impact of this improvement, as people are finding their way to these settings a lot more often. There are contrast settings on both <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-color-contrast-in-windows-fedc744c-90ac-69df-aed5-c8a90125e696">Windows</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/lv-lv/guide/mac-help/unac089/mac">Mac</a>.</p>
Detecting Our Contrast Issues
<p>You can follow along by <a href="https://codepen.io/utilitybend/pen/GRBKoNB">viewing the full demo of this on CodePen</a> while you read through the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/3-colors-contrast-check-styles-panel.png" /></p>
<p>It actually shows how far away your contrast ratio is to provide a double or triple-A ratio. Another neat feature of this is the little white line you can see in this screenshot, which actually shows the range you should go to for the right amount of contrast. This might come in handy when we start changing our colors. Also, notice the suggested color next to the “AA” ratio score.</p>
<p>But there is another handy feature for our initial detection when it comes to contrast issues, which is the <strong>“CSS Overview”</strong> panel. If you don’t have this, it’s probably still hidden; you can access this by pressing the <strong>three dots</strong> on DevTools  and selecting <strong>more tools &gt; CSS Overview.</strong></p>
<p>Select the colors tab inside of this overview, and you will get all your contrast issues right away.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/4-css-overview-contrast-colors.png" /></p>
<p>As expected, we are having some contrast issues. We’re not getting to the minimum of an “AA” in most cases. We can optimize quite a bit, so let’s get to it and create some more happy customers to try our delicious cupcakes.</p>
Optimizing Our Contrast Issues
<p>The first thing we want to do is actually view our page while enabling this media query. No need to use a special plugin or change settings for that — DevTools has got it covered.</p>
<p>We will need to open our rendering drawer in order to do so. If you don’t have this drawer, you can press cmd+Shift+p in DevTools and type in rendering and select it; this should open that drawer.</p>
<p>There are a lot of options here to test our website for accessibility, also including reduced motion (which is always a great practice take care of). But we will be focussing on the “Emulate CSS media feature prefers-contrast.” Select this option and set it to “more.”</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/5-emulate-css-media-feature-prefers-contrast.png" /></p>
<p>So far, nothing has changed on our website, but we will be able to change our colors now, and since this emulation keeps active while refreshing, it can really speed up our optimization. </p>
<p>Inside our root declaration, let’s add that media query we talked about. I am using Scss for this demo, but it’s certainly not a requirement.</p>
<pre><code>:root {
    --color-champagne: #EFD9CE;
    --color-tiffany: #07BEB8;
    --color-blizzard: #98DFEA;
    --color-plum: #8F3985;
    --color-space: #25283D;
    --color-lightest: #FAFAFA;
    --color-logo-basket: #F8E6C4;
    --color-logo-topping: #FF89C0;

    @media (prefers-contrast: more) {
    /* let's overwrite our colors here */
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the bigger problems we detected was our navigation. Our “plum” color is already pretty dark, so maybe we can make this a bit darker already.</p>
<pre><code>:root {
    /* original colors here */
    @media (prefers-contrast: more) {
        --color-plum: #591D52;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result is staggering, and we can already measure a lot more contrast:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/6-cupcake-factory-navigation-bar.png" /></p>
<p>But when taking a closer look at our navigation, we notice that we achieved our “AA” ratio. As this is the navigation, I especially want to achieve a “AAA” ratio here. Since our logo is in SVG, we will change the topping of our cupcake logo as well. This might not be needed, but it will create some harmony in our high-contrast design. So let’s turn to our DevTools again to change the links and cupcake color.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/7-devtools-view-color-contrast.png" /></p>
<p>We are so close to getting our ratio of 7. What’s handy about this view in DevTools, is that it actually suggests a color to get better contrast and shows two different lines between the different ratios. Let’s click on the color that was proposed. And add the new hex code to our custom properties.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>We could use <code>rgb()</code> or <code>hsl()</code> as well. We can even toggle between color modes inside the DevTools panel.</em></p>
<pre><code>:root {
    /*our original colors */
    @media (prefers-contrast: more) {
        --color-plum: #591D52;
        --color-logo-topping: #FFAED3;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this for a few more of our colors, the final result looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/8-cupycake-factory-website-text-decoration.png" /></p>
<p>We’re really close but our quote actually got a bit worse in the process. This is why we sometimes have to take control of our specific components.</p>
<p>We selected the color based on the container of our CTA, so let’s overwrite this:</p>
<pre><code>.container {
          /*other styles*/
        color: var(--color-logo-topping);
        @media (prefers-contrast: more) {
            color: var(--color-plum);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When it comes to our contrast, we pretty much nailed it. But there are <strong>a few things missing</strong>. At the moment, the navigation’s active state is only differentiated by color. The same goes for our clickable cards, where the only indication is a hover state.</p>
<p><strong>Always make sure active states and possible actions are clearly visible. Make sure you rely on more than just color to indicate that something is active and/or clickable.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s indicate the links and active state more clearly by adding a text decoration on the link itself. </p>
<pre><code>@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
        text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you find a text-decoration to be a bit boring for the active state, you can always take another approach such as adding an arrow indicator before the active element. The choice is yours, as long as you don’t rely on colors alone.</p>
<p>The final design looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/9-cupcake-factory-website-final-result.png" /></p>
Going A Bit Deeper With Visual Deficiencies
<p>We can do a lot more checks for our contrast. How about checking some visual deficiencies? In our rendering tab, we can select some of those to have a look at our page. I suggest we toggle through them.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/10-test-visual-deficiencies.png" /></p>
<p>Achromatopsia, for example, is about having a very poor ability to see colors. While my cupcake factory wasn’t optimized for this at all, when combining this deficiency with the high contrast media query and adding a text-decoration to my cupcake list, it looks very good. You can emulate a lot of other deficiencies with this tool. There are many types of color blindness that you can check with them. Make sure you give them a try.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-contrast-custom-properties/11-cupcake-factory-website-color-blindness-test.png" /></p>
A Final Conclusion On Contrast
<p>Managing our colors will truly help people to access our content. I also love the idea that we can add meaningful design value to those users. Will a user with achromatopsia browse our website in high contrast? Has the user actually enabled a high-contrast setting? These are questions that we can never know the answer to. <strong>Not relying on media queries for this is and will always be the best approach</strong>, but it’s nice to have this possibility in CSS for tackling those edge cases. So, by all means, don’t ever rely on them for a complete website; this is just a demo to show the possibility. </p>
<p>Thinking about our users, spreading awareness, and exploring possibilities are certainly big steps in the right direction.</p>
<p>The best practice is always to create a website that has a good contrast to start with. I actually liked the high-contrast version of this little demo more and struggled to create the low-contrast version. But even though I’m (certainly) not the best designer out there, I’ve seen some examples where low-contrast design fits the branding (unfortunately).</p>
<p>CSS is growing at a rapid pace, and more tools are becoming available to us. But no matter which method you use now or in the future, if you have already added some value for users that struggle with contrast issues, you certainly are making the world (wide web) a better place.</p>

<p>Although you might be able to map out the development of a new product with a definitive start and end date, there really is no end point. </p>
<p>The most successful digital products are the ones continually being debugged, updated and enhanced. By extension, the most successful brands are ones that draw valuable lessons from the development of one product and apply it to other products as well as the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Today, I’m going to dig into Maze’s <a href="https://maze.co/resources/continuous-research-report/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">Continuous Research Report: Trends to Watch in 2023</a>. Developed in partnership with Atlassian, the report presents data from over 600 product professionals and explores how product teams conduct research to inform their decision-making.</p>
<p>In the following post, we’re going to explore the current state of product research, the trends shaping the future of the industry and the benefits of <em>continuous</em> discovery and research. Then we’ll look at some tips for making continuous discovery part of your process going forward. </p>
The Current State of Product Research
<p>A product doesn’t become successful simply because a great product team builds it and a savvy marketing team promotes it. A digital product has to be well-built, align with user expectations, and effectively solve their problems. It also needs to evolve over time as customer needs evolve. </p>
<p>This is why user input is so critical in the grand scheme of product development.</p>
<p>More and more organizations understand how valuable this data is, with 83% of Maze’s survey respondents agreeing that research should be conducted at every stage of product development.</p>
<p>However, data suggests that only 36% of digital product teams perform research post-launch. In addition, 60% connect with customers only once a month (if that), despite making product-related decisions on a daily basis.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/better-roi-digital-products-continous-research/maze-report-product-development-stage-research.png" /></p>
<p>Gathering user input during both the Discovery and Delivery phases is essential. Without user input early on, product teams end up building products based on generalizations, assumptions, and biases. Concrete data and feedback, on the other hand, provide product professionals with a clearer roadmap of what to build along with validation that what they’re building is on the right track. </p>
<p>Here’s what the <a href="https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/continuous/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">continuous product discovery process</a> looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/better-roi-digital-products-continous-research/maze-continuous-product-lifecycle.png" /></p>
<p>According to the report, 78% of respondents believe that their company isn’t doing enough research or could be doing it more frequently. When asked what’s keeping them from doing continuous discovery and research or doing enough of it, limitations related to time, budget, respondent recruitment and tooling were the most common reasons.</p>
<p>The good news is that companies are starting to involve users continuously throughout the product development process. One way they’re doing this is by <a href="https://maze.co/resources/scaling-research-playbook/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">democratizing research</a>. In addition to researchers, designers (69%), product managers (54%), marketers (28%), and engineers (10%) conduct research at their companies. </p>
<p>By empowering every team to engage in research, product organizations can uncover customer needs and motivation and constantly improve their product as they build.</p>
<p>While there are still some challenges holding product teams back, continuous discovery and research is becoming a more established practice.</p>
The Benefits of Doing Continuous Discovery and Research for Your Digital Products
<p>We’ve all felt the strain that the above limitations can put on our work. To relieve that strain, we often look for ways to cut corners or to do without, at least for the time being. </p>
<p><strong>But can you afford to cut corners when it comes to product research?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s have a look at some of the things that happen when you perform continuous research on your product. Then you can decide if this is something you can afford to cut short or limit resources to.</p>
<h3>1. Eliminate Assumptions in Product Decision-making</h3>
<p>Rachel Lynch, the Research Manager for Productboard, had this to say about continuous discovery:</p>
<p><em>“Many research resources are being put into the design process, problem discovery and solution testing, but not so much into post-launch reviews. I think that’s a huge gap and a missed opportunity because you only know if something will work once you launch it. You should be using those same research tactics to try and figure out if you were successful once something has gone live.”</em></p>
<p>Data collection in the first stage of the product development journey can reveal a lot about your <em>target</em> users along with their needs, expectations and hesitations. It also helps you to uncover what you should be building. </p>
<p>However, a product is never really done. Because of this, there’s always more to discover about your product and users, which is why the process needs to extend throughout the entire development lifecycle. </p>
<p>The only way to ensure that you’re building the best products and experiences is to perform continuous research and gather meaningful insights from <em>real</em> users long after your product launches.</p>
<h3>2. Keep Products in Sync with User Needs</h3>
<p>According to Xiangyi Tang, the Head of User Research over at Pitch, continuous research allows products to remain valuable and useful to users over time:</p>
<p><em>“Product organizations need to truly understand their customers to be competitive. With continuous research, they can constantly course-correct to work on the right problem and provide the right solution.”</em></p>
<p>Users change over time. Brands change over time. So too do the products they build. It’s natural for user needs and desires to evolve. In some cases, it happens because of a shift in how the industry operates. In others, it’s because the industry or economy as a whole has been disrupted.</p>
<p>Take product organizations that build software for restaurants, for instance. The restaurant industry has gone through major changes over the past few years. If product organizations weren’t regularly reviewing market changes or conducting research with users, they might not have known how to keep their restaurant software products up to date or have been able to pivot sooner than the competition.</p>
<p>Continuous research is basically a form of active listening. By paying attention to how things are changing all around you and your product, you can proactively develop new features, pivot your product or develop new ones entirely in response to what you’re “hearing”.</p>
<h3>3. Validate Your Concepts Before Development</h3>
<p>A minimum viable product (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/mvp-app-development/">MVP</a>) is a scaled-back version of a product. Developers initially build it with just the core features that users need in order to use and derive value from it. It’s through the process of continuous research that product teams are able to validate and refine their product ideas pre-development. </p>
<p>Because of this methodical and iterative approach, an MVP greatly reduces how much time and money is spent developing a digital product. For instance, fixing an error after a product launch can <a href="https://www.celerity.com/insights/the-true-cost-of-a-software-bug">cost up to 100 times more</a> than if it’s caught during development. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.productboard.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product-mvp/">Productboard</a> has an illustration that perfectly sums up how a lower monetary investment in a product keeps risks low. And how the effort to recover from and rebuild a faulty product remains low as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/better-roi-digital-products-continous-research/productboard-risk-vs-roi-mvp.png" /></p>
<p>This is one of the strongest arguments for doing research. You can save yourself so much wasted time and energy during initial product builds by focusing on developing core features that make the product usable and useful. Continuous research and testing will then allow you to naturally evolve a product into its best self.</p>
<h3>4. Create More Satisfying User Experiences</h3>
<p>With ongoing research, you can gather real-time insights and test new features that allow users to have more meaningful and valuable interactions with your product. This in turn translates to greater company success. Basing decisions on real user data — at the product, team <em>and</em> corporate level — ensures that customers’ needs are always at the center of what you’re building.</p>
<p>According to respondents, product research has a positive impact on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer satisfaction score (57%);</li>
<li>Product/feature adoption (55%);</li>
<li>Active users (46%);</li>
<li>Revenue/profitability (42%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Products informed by user input lead to greater customer satisfaction. Not only that, they hold onto their users for longer. This alone is good for boosting user satisfaction through product development. Long-term data gathered from the same user set can be much more meaningful than data from a steady stream of new and random users.</p>
<p>It’s also important to consider that satisfied long-time users cost much less to manage and maintain. This means you won’t have to spend as much time or effort on marketing to attract as many new customers. </p>
<p>Also, product bugs and security breaches are less likely to occur when you’re keeping a close eye on your product. This results in less money spent on putting out fires and dealing with PR fiascos.</p>
<h3>5. Make More Effective Decisions Company-Wide</h3>
<p>Data is valuable for organizations and their product teams. </p>
<p>According to Maze’s respondents, 74% of product professionals believe research is effective or partially effective in determining decision-making at their organizations, and 14% say it's highly effective. </p>
<p>In particular, the report shows that product teams who conduct research more often (weekly or daily) report more effective decision-making than those who conduct research less often (quarterly or yearly).</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/better-roi-digital-products-continous-research/product-teams-effective-decision-making.png" /></p>
<p>Respondents also reported that this data can enable different types of decision-making. For instance: </p>
<ul>
<li>42% of product professionals leverage data to inform all of their product decision-making. </li>
<li>49% of organizations use research findings to make strategic decisions. </li>
<li>60% of product professionals say that recommendations from research findings inspire new product opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears as though the research conducted on one product isn’t just valuable for the product in question but for the organization as a whole when it comes to making strategic decisions. And it's even more valuable when it comes to inspiring new products.</p>
<p>Continuous research can have a positive impact on more than just product and executive leadership teams. Lucy Denton, the Head of Design at Dovetail, says:</p>
<p><em>“Today, research is really focused on understanding the user experience, which directly fits into the experience design of the product. It would be interesting to see how companies evolve to focus more on the customer in other functions like marketing, sales or customer support. They all talk to customers and need to understand the customers to do their job.”</em></p>
<p>By making this data readily available to the organization at large, imagine what it could do for sales, marketing and customer service. An ongoing stream of real user feedback could improve every aspect of the company.</p>
How to Make Continuous Discovery Part of Your Process
<p>In a recent <a href="https://maze.co/blog/making-better-product-decisions-with-teresa-torres/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">interview, product discovery coach Teresa Torres</a> explains how and why a continuous discovery mindset in product development is important today:</p>
<p><em>“Historically, businesses made discovery decisions by just sitting in a room and thinking ‘what should we build?’ Over the last 20 years, we've seen an evolution toward including the customer a lot more in the process.”</em></p>
<p>Human-centered design is what we’re all striving for today. The only way to ensure that products continue to meet and exceed user expectations is to gather continual feedback from them and test new hypotheses and concepts on them. </p>
<p>If you want to make continuous discovery part of your process, here are some tips to get you started:</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Schedule Time for It</h3>
<p>If you make time for it, then you’ll have no excuse not to do it. As for how much time you should devote to continuous discovery, the more frequently it’s done, the better. </p>
<p>According to Maze’s analysis, product teams doing research on a monthly or more frequent basis rated it as more effective than those who only did it quarterly or yearly. Teresa Torres suggests that weekly is best:</p>
<p><em>“At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers by the team building the product, where they're conducting small research activities in pursuit of a desired product outcome.”</em></p>
<p>Block off a weekly recurring time for discovery. You can start with as little as 30 minutes before increasing the frequency of customer interactions.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Make It Part of Your Project Proposal</h3>
<p>Research is a marathon that extends across the entire product life cycle. If you’re not in the habit of considering post-launch activities as part of your project proposal, timeline or budget, now is a good time to start doing so. </p>
<p>Research should never be considered an “extra” or an afterthought. By building it into your process from the beginning, you’ll ensure research is not seen as a set of individual studies but as a continuous learning cycle.</p>
<h3>Tip #3: Implement the Right Research Tools</h3>
<p>One of the biggest limitations product teams have in adopting a continuous mindset and approach is tooling. </p>
<p>The UX tools landscape has grown a lot in recent years. Each platform offers a unique collection of features and functionalities that product and UX researchers are looking for. </p>
<p><a href="https://maze.co/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">Maze</a>, for instance, is a continuous product discovery platform that offers unified solutions for discovery — from prototype testing and surveys to card sorting and video recordings. You can also use it to recruit participants and generate automated reports for every piece of research you run.</p>
<p>The key is to find the right platforms for your product development lifecycle and the various research and testing methods you plan to use. Here are <a href="https://maze.co/guides/ux-research/ux-research-tools/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">13 UX research tools</a> to explore now. </p>
<h3>Tip #4: Mix-and-Match Methods</h3>
<p>Just because there are dozens of types of product research and testing methods, that doesn’t mean you have to do them all in order to get meaningful results. The trick is to <a href="https://maze.co/guides/ux-research/ux-research-methods/#choose-method?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">choose the right research methods</a> — i.e. ones that help you reach your research goals more effectively.  For instance: </p>
<p><strong>Primary vs. Secondary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary data directly comes from your end users.</li>
<li>Secondary data comes from already existing data related to the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qualitative vs. Quantitative:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative data relates to the user’s opinions and feelings. This type of research is key to developing a deep understanding of a problem or uncovering the ‘why’ behind actions. </li>
<li>Quantitative data relates to the statistical/numerical data gathered from users to answer research questions such as ‘what’, ‘where’ or ‘when’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluative vs. Generative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluative research is used to evaluate a product or concept and collect data that helps improve your solutions. </li>
<li>Generative research is used to develop a deep understanding of your users and the problem you’re trying to solve for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using different types of research will give you a more well-rounded idea of what’s going on with your users and can make your research more cost-effective. Depending on your project objective and resources, for example, you can opt for more unmoderated studies and panels as opposed to moderated ones that require live control and monitoring in the data gathering sessions. </p>
<h3>Tip #5: Get Everyone Involved</h3>
<p>Everyone in your organization can benefit from and contribute to product research — for example: product managers, designers, marketers, salespeople, customer support representatives and so on. So why should a dedicated UX researcher or team be the only one to gather insights? </p>
<p>Caitlin McCurrie, the Research Lead at Atlassian, discusses why <a href="https://maze.co/resources/scaling-research-playbook/?utm_source=smashing-magazine&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=report-sponsored-article">research democratization</a> is a must to scale the impact of research:</p>
<p><em>“While I strongly believe that dedicated research professionals are a necessary component for a successful tech company, there will never be enough researchers to cover the range and volume of research needs within an organization. We will always need our teammates to engage in some form of research—whether collaborating with a dedicated researcher or running their own studies.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not just an issue of data volume. People in different roles will view the research from their unique perspectives, which can lead to additional discoveries and suggestions than you might otherwise get.</p>
Wrapping Up
<p>While a lot of product teams conduct research at the product discovery stage or validation and testing stage, only a few continue with the process after launch. However, think of all the benefits that come from doing product research. Now multiply those results by every time you connect with users to discover new ways to improve your product.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/user-ratings-distribution-summary">95% of users rely on reviews</a> to make their decisions and learn more about how well a product fits their needs. Unfortunately, too often, the way we design <strong>reviews and ratings UX</strong> confuses and frustrates users, rather than helps them. Let’s fix that.</p>

What Customers Search In Reviews
<p>We often assume that the only thing that a best-selling product needs is a <strong>high number of positive reviews</strong>. Positive reviews indeed are needed to build up trust, but just as many users need to be convinced that a product would work for them. This shows up in a few attributes that customers seek to verify in reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product is indeed of <strong>high quality</strong> as advertised,</li>
<li>They aren’t overpaying: the <strong>pricing is fair and acceptable</strong>,</li>
<li>They’ve chosen <strong>the right product</strong> that addresses their needs well,</li>
<li>People like them (similar age group, experience, needs) were satisfied with the product,</li>
<li>They haven’t missed any <strong>critical details</strong> (accessories not included, different sizing),</li>
<li>The <strong>risk is low and manageable</strong> (simple return policy, cancellation process, 30-days-money-back-guarantee),</li>
<li>The <strong>worst thing that could happen to them</strong> due to purchase (poor customer service that’s hard to reach, fraudulent activities that have been flagged).</li>
</ul>
<p>All these fine little details are quite difficult to decipher from a standalone, beautiful 5-star rating on a landing page. So how can we communicate with them to remove doubts and concerns? Well, we can start off with negative reviews, which often can be way more helpful than not.</p>
Reward Negative Reviews
<p>We shouldn’t be surprised by the fact that most customers, when shopping online, meticulously study <strong>negative reviews first,</strong> and they need enough of those to tackle the concerns and skepticism most customers almost instinctively come with. The more specific negative reviews are, the easier customers can connect the dots and reach that threshold of trust. Especially if all negative reviews simply don’t apply to them.</p>
<p>Most negative reviews focus on <strong>specific things that went wrong</strong> during the purchase. For most decent products and most decent brands, that isn’t going to be a particularly long list. It might be that the customer service reaches its busyness spikes every now and again, or that promised delivery times weren’t achieved during holidays, or that there is a high severity bug in the application that’s being solved that week. These things, however, wouldn’t be relevant throughout the entire year (hopefully!).</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ee81568-9b50-400e-80dc-3a63a7ba638b/1-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>However, it might be that a product is incredibly faulty, confusing, malicious, or intricately complex — and that the cancellation process is designed to keep as many paying customers as possible. Users will <strong>watch out for any red flags</strong> that might indicate just that. And the lack of negative reviews altogether is one of those red flags, as it might be hiding some critical underlying issues.</p>
<p>Not every negative review is negative, though. It’s worth repeating that customers tend to seek customer feedback <strong>from people like themselves</strong> on issues that are relevant to them. If negative reviews mostly focus on poor packaging for shipping overseas or low brightness outdoors, it might be less of an issue for a customer ordering in the same country with the intent to use a device at home. These issues are definitely less critical than any notion of “extremely buggy,” “horrible customer support,” “major refund troubles,” or “severe cancellation issues.”</p>
<p>Chances are high that you will need some negative reviews to appear trustworthy; they will, in fact, increase conversion rates and boost customers’ confidence. That’s why you should consider encouraging customers to <strong>write honest negative reviews</strong> and ask them to be very specific about the parts of the experience they didn’t like. Also, prompt them to explain if the issue has been successfully resolved in the end. To do that, you could reward users with bonus points or coupon codes that they could redeem with their next billing cycle or with their next purchase.</p>
Always Show Decimal Ratings And Number Of Ratings
<p>Another detail that customers often rely on is a <strong>precise estimation</strong> of the experience that similar customers have had. In that regard, many websites don’t go far enough, though. Frequently we can spot <strong>bright orange stars</strong> used as indicators of how great or poor the experience has been, but there are <em>vast</em> differences and nuances between “4 stars”- and “5 stars”-experiences, yet they are somehow getting lost between two aggressively rounded scores.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8d3277ca-e496-400f-83fa-0bfa3ae4b83d/2-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>The problem is that stars alone <strong>don’t provide enough context</strong>, nor do they provide a detailed enough explanation. With this pattern,</p>
<ul>
<li>we can’t easily tell what exactly customers liked or disliked;</li>
<li>we can’t tell how satisfied users with a profile similar to ours are;</li>
<li>we can’t say what’s particularly good or particularly bad about the product;</li>
<li>it’s impossible to distinguish between products with a rating closer to 4.0 and a rating closer to 5.0. The difference between them, however, is vast.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5eadccac-3675-4b66-9487-1e55ca6418dd/4-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>In order for us to provide a slightly better assessment, our rating scores could be a bit more precise. As a general rule, it’s <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/user-perception-of-product-ratings">always a good idea</a> to display a <strong>decimal average score</strong> (e.g., <em>4.7 out of 5</em>) and <strong>the total number of reviews</strong> (<em>78 reviews</em>) together. The average decimal score provides a more granular estimate, while the total number of reviews guarantees a high enough number of reviewers contributing to that score.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/713eb678-c77d-498c-b87a-35624d663a70/27-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/products/mint-subscription">Bite</a> prominently highlights the total number of reviews, but it doesn’t reveal an average score. However, once a product reaches 19,348 reviews (overwhelmingly positive), displaying an average score might not be as necessary.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/user-perception-of-product-ratings">number of reviews matters significantly</a>. In usability testing, customers “often show greater <strong>preference towards</strong> some products with 4.5-star averages than some with perfect 5-star ratings due to the number of reviews that these averages are based on”. In fact, 70% of customers would pick the one with the higher number of ratings despite its lower average.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4d0190ec-493f-460f-9ab8-f1da8ed1c0b2/6-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>For example, for two otherwise identical products, where one product has a product ranking of 4.5 with 180 reviews and another has 4.8 with 39 reviews, a majority of customers are likely to choose the first one, despite a lower average. That’s also why it’s critical to <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">mix the number of ratings and average score</a> to avoid the bias towards products with a <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/sort-by-customer-ratings">better ranking but lower number of reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a <strong>perfect score</strong>, by the way? Well, as long as your product’s score is somewhere <strong>between 4.5 and 4.89</strong> — with a high enough (75+) number of reviews, you probably shouldn’t be worrying too much about its competitiveness. When a rating score hits anywhere beyond 4.9, customers start getting suspicious; that’s when they slow down and search for traps and flaws that aren’t explicitly stated. Unsurprisingly it doesn’t help in closing sales.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because in real life, anything sincere with a score <strong>above 4.9</strong> is very hard to come by and hence less likely to be true — unless it’s based on a very small sample of biased and dishonest reviews. Don’t feel tempted or pressured to hit that average user rating, though, as it’s not the only detail that customers pay attention to.</p>
Display A Full Rating Distribution Summary
<p>In addition to bright yellow stars, over the years, we’ve learned to rely on <strong>distribution summaries for ratings</strong>. They explain the relation between high-score reviews vs. low-score reviews and give customers a more granular overview of how good the product is on average for most people. There, we can tell quicker if most customers had an overwhelmingly positive or negative experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e885fd0-abe5-47fb-b585-608b82ea8226/7-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>We do so by looking for <strong>specific patterns</strong> in the rating distribution summary. As users, we quickly eliminate options with a disproportionate number of low-score reviews. We quickly eliminate options with a disproportionate number of mid-score reviews. And we abandon options without any low-score reviews.</p>
<p>We almost instinctively search for <em>the</em> pattern — the one perfect, trustworthy distribution that is representative of good products. In it, we need to find <em>a lot of</em> positive reviews and <em>enough</em> negative reviews.</p>
<p>Typically this means that a <strong>vast majority of ratings will be 5-star-reviews</strong>, followed by plenty of 4-star reviews, and eventually followed by a large enough (but not too large!) number of low-score reviews. Most importantly, there must be <em>enough</em> negative reviews to give customers pointers about the most negative experience they might have. Usually, products that match that perfect pattern appear most trustworthy and perform best.</p>
<p>In user research, this “perfect” pattern is called the <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-problem-of-j-curves-in-online-ratings-systems-caf94fab4819">J-shaped distribution pattern</a>. However, as it turns out, it’s not really that perfect and conceals some troubles for businesses.</p>
The J-Shaped Distribution Issues
<p>You might be wondering why that particular rating distribution has such an unusual name. The distribution resembles a capital letter “J”, with a small spike of the most negative reviews (★), a flat middle ground (★★, ★★★), and a high spike of the most positive ones (★★★★★). It is very different from the omnipresent, classic bell curve that we might have expected initially.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/49c82767-50c4-4a44-8308-9cc007751cc7/25-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>In the examples for IMDB scores of “Game of Thrones” and “Avatar: The Way of Water,” you’ll notice that the distribution in the top scores is much clearer for “Game of Thrones” and much less conclusive for “Avatar: The Way of Water.” Despite a stronger negative scoring in the lower ratings, the distribution of “Game of Thrones” is likely to perform much better — both in movies and for any other products.</p>
<p>We can also notice that in both cases, the lowest score (Rating 1) gets a disproportionate amount of attention. That’s the “J”-shaped distribution in action. Why does it happen?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-problem-of-j-curves-in-online-ratings-systems-caf94fab4819">Sav Sidorov</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7015971063515725824/">Nikita Sharaev</a> explain, user feedback is <strong>often skewed towards the extremes</strong>. Customers who are just satisfied may not take the time to leave a review or rating, but those who are either extremely happy or extremely frustrated are more likely to do so. This makes rating scores very vulnerable to the strongest opinions of the extremes and hence biased and inaccurate.</p>
<p>An alternative design that Sav has suggested includes four options: <strong>↑</strong>, <strong>↓</strong>, <strong>↑↑</strong>, and <strong>↓↓</strong>. When providing a review, customers could click or tap multiple times to provide a stronger assessment. This might eliminate the large spread between the extremes.</p>
<p>Another option is to introduce a <strong>delay for reviews</strong>. As Marianna Alshina <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7015971063515725824?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7015971063515725824%2C7015995190435794946%29">noticed</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> doesn’t allow its customers to review products straight away. They have to wait for one week to have a “full” experience with the product, and only then leave pictures and their review.</p>
<p>Will it work? Maybe. </p>
<p>Either way, the <strong>distribution needs context that explains it</strong>. And that’s where breaking the rating distribution summary by product attributes can help.</p>
Break Rating Distribution Summary By Product Attributes
<p>Showing a distribution summary provides a better overview to customers, but it still requires quite a bit of effort to discover how well-performing a specific product attribute is. For example, a customer might be interested in how long the battery life is or how sophisticated a particular feature is. To learn both, they’ll need to sip through dozens or even hundreds of reviews, often without any success.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/06af9fa7-712b-4987-8f7c-521c247989f7/8-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>A useful approach to help out customers there is to break down the distribution summary even further. <strong>For each standalone product attribute</strong> — appearance, value for money, product quality, battery life, etc. — we could gather and <strong>highlight average scores,</strong> based on user reviews. When a customer chooses to provide their feedback, we could ask them to evaluate specific qualities of the product and then calculate a separate average score for each attribute.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d77c0ffd-e097-4659-ae14-a373d5e4f82a/26-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/samsung-1-5-ton-5-star-split-inverter-ac-white/product-reviews/itm1a2f33df93c02?pid=ACNGADBFVHZE4ZFV&amp;lid=LSTACNGADBFVHZE4ZFVRB2YHV&amp;sortOrder=MOST_HELPFUL&amp;certifiedBuyer=false&amp;aid=overall">Flipkart</a> (pictured above), customers are encouraged to provide feedback broken down into groups of attributes that are very specific for the product. The “Value for Money” is a classic one that is being used across all products. The color coding is used to indicate “good” and “bad” reviews, but a slightly different color scheme would be more accessible. Also, unfortunately, customers can’t filter reviews by a particular score.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d915690f-9870-416a-b4e4-ff41ae3dc458/28-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.adidas.de/en/adidas-tlrd-impact-training-high-support-bra/HM7901.html">Adidas</a> and <a href="https://global.llbean.com/">LL Bean</a>, customers can explore specific qualities of a product in a bit more detail. It can be a position on a scale or yet another distribution summary. Both patterns make it clear to customers how well a product performs in relation to that one specific attribute.</p>
Enhance User Reviews With Suggested Tags
<p>The quality of the experience can’t be measured by product attributes alone. A skillfully designed and manufactured product might not be a good fit for some customers, and learning it from a product description spec is impossible. To help there, we could <strong>suggest relevant tags when customers write a review.</strong> Typically, it could be something along the lines of “great fit,” “great for kids,” “easy to use,” “love the design,” “beautiful packaging,” etc.</p>
<p>These tags could also be slightly <strong>more personal and individual</strong>; they could relate to the product but also to the customers who have already purchased that product. The goal here is to <strong>gather and surface insights and personal details</strong> that would make it easier for prospective customers to relate to published reviews. In other words, we try to help prospective customers find similarities with already existing customers and explore their reviews in that light.</p>
<p>Personal details could be anything from the frequency of use and level of experience to age range and current location. But it would differ depending on the product, of course. For skin products, for example, we could ask about the preferred look, <strong>skin type, shade, glow, scent,</strong> characteristics of the face, but also texture and typical type of makeup. That’s exactly what <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/futuredew">Glossier</a> and <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?skuId=1221084&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p253818:product">Sephora</a> do.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1183f71d-202e-4925-82f1-e06631b25018/11-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f839c9aa-038e-4e99-a882-1b6862cc9a23/12-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>These tags, then, could be displayed as <strong>additional rating filters</strong> — and hence help customers find relevant reviews faster, and perhaps even scores for important attributes, based on feedback from customers like them. And that’s much more valuable than any general feedback based on averages could be.</p>
Highlight Social Proof From Reviews
<p>In addition to suggested tags, one of the questions we could ask existing customers at the very end of the review is if they’d recommend this product to their friends, colleagues, or total strangers. As a result, we could calculate a quite significant number that’s often neglected but can be quite a game-changer: the <strong>recommendation score</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bb14dbf6-c836-4bb7-946a-b055349db1ce/13-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.asos.com/us/new-balance/new-balance-unisex-530-sneakers-in-beige-and-silver-exclusive-to-asos/prd/203555242?clr=beige-silver&amp;colourWayId=203555243&amp;cid=6456">Asos</a> (pictured above) highlights that “86% of customers recommend this product.” This is quite different from 5-star ratings or 1-star ratings because even customers who aren’t quite happy with the product and would perhaps give it a 3-star rating might still recommend it to their friends. It might not be a perfect fit for them, but they are quite satisfied with its quality.</p>
<p>Highlighting prominently how many customers actually recommend the product is definitely a good idea. A magical number to stay above is <strong>90% recommendation score</strong>; yet again, if you climb over 95%, it’s getting a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>To make it even stronger, you could <strong>specify the group of customers</strong> that actually has recommended the product and allow customers to choose the group that would fit them best. There, we could include fine details such as level of experience, frequency of use, type of projects, and others.</p>
<p>A statement such as “86% of customers (5+ years of experience, enterprise-level) recommend this product” would probably perform the strongest for people who fit that particular group.</p>
Provide Quick Summaries Of Pros And Cons
<p>We’ve come quite far already, yet customers still need to filter and explore reviews on their own. We could help them faster grasp the good bits and the bad bits about the products though. To do that, we could highlight the pros and cons of a product, along with <strong>quick summaries</strong> of positive and negative reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6240909e-441d-40c8-98ec-d52b66d2c747/14-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Ideally, these quick summaries would be analyzing user reviews and listing pros and cons as <strong>bullet points</strong>. This information is precious and often not displayed at the right time. For example, it would be a <strong>very impactful add-on</strong> for a category listing page, a product page, and a feature comparison page where users land when they try to compare a couple of products side-by-side.</p>
Allow Users To Mark Helpful Reviews
<p>Not every review is helpful. Some reviews appear very generic, others lack important details, and others again focus too much on irrelevant details. To make sure that <strong>relevant reviews get surfaced to the top</strong> of the reviews list, we could kindly prompt users to mark if they find a review helpful — both for positive and negative reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7a0b70b3-55ca-4c5c-8653-cf2409fe7da2/16-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Marked reviews — a few of each kind — could then be highlighted at the top of the reviews section, along with the number of users who found them helpful. This dramatically boosts trustworthiness and reduces time to relevance, as highlighted reviews have been validated by other customers. This appears authentic and builds trust.</p>
Provide Helpful Sorting Types and Search Autocomplete
<p>We typically allow users to filter reviews by a particular rating score, but what if a customer is interested in specific details <em>within</em> a particular score range? Once a filter has been applied, we can allow users to sort by <strong>specific details of reviews</strong>. On <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/products/mint-subscription">Bite</a>, for example, users can sort by the date of review, available photos and videos, as well as highest and lowest ratings and most and least helpful reviews. That’s better.</p>

<p>Additionally, customers on <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/futuredew">Glossier</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/932544113?filter=3https://www.wayfair.com/decor-pillows/pdp/alwyn-home-roisin-square-pillow-insert-w001225688.html">Wayfair</a> can sort by reviews that include customer photos and <strong>search in reviews,</strong> and that’s where an autocomplete feature could be particularly helpful as well. Notice how Wayfair (pictured below) not only displays the tags used for products and customer photos but also highlights how often the keywords have been mentioned in reviews. That’s helpful.</p>

Enhance Reviews With Personal Details
<p>For a review to be convincing, it needs to <strong>appear trustworthy</strong>, be written by an actual person with credentials and a public social presence, or be recommended by a brand or person that carries some weight. This is why testimonials and logos of big brands work well; this is also why video reviews and customer success stories are quite impactful.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/066ae987-b0fc-4af9-bda4-0e83ad105c80/20-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>If possible, prompt your users to add some personal details to their reviews, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>full name,</li>
<li>location,</li>
<li>age (range),</li>
<li>current role or job title,</li>
<li>link to a social media account (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram),</li>
<li>a casual personal photo,</li>
<li>a casual personal video (less than 30 sec),</li>
<li>a photo of the product,</li>
<li>the logo of the brand they work for (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ae5a013-842d-4e24-9d3c-30273ae19a28/21-designing-perfect-reviews-ratings-ux.png" /></p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to build authenticity with a review is to <strong>display customer photos</strong> prominently next to reviews. Because many customers don’t trust marketing illustrations or can’t reliably visualize product specs, they often rely on customers’ (unedited) product photos to get a more realistic preview of what they should be expecting.</p>
<p>Any personal details are very valuable. Hence it’s a good idea to <strong>always prompt users to upload personal product photos</strong> and more details about themselves and reward such reviews as well.</p>
Wrapping Up
<p>Getting user ratings right requires quite a bit of work. We need to gather and highlight relevant reviews, present distribution charts with the number of ratings and decimal averages, and allow users to use filters, tags, or search to find reviews faster from people who are very much like them.</p>
<p>Users need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average score presented with decimal numbers;</li>
<li>An overall number of ratings;</li>
<li>A <strong>full distribution chart</strong> of ratings;</li>
<li>Customer’s <strong>unedited product photos</strong>;</li>
<li>Ratings for individual features (size, fit, support, etc.);</li>
<li>The number of reviews for intermediate values (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);</li>
<li><strong>Tags and filters</strong> to find relevant reviews;</li>
<li>Personal details that will help customers find people like them in the reviews;</li>
<li>The date of when the review was written or published;</li>
<li>How many people <strong>find it helpful</strong>;</li>
<li>How many customers (%) recommend the product for purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sounds like a lot of effort</strong> — and it actually is. The impact of a proper user rating design can be remarkable and drive your sales efforts much stronger than any other campaign could have. And once it’s done, it can work for you long-term, building up a community of people who trust your brand and recommend it online and offline. Without any doubt, that’s very much worth the effort.</p>

<p>I doubt many designers sit down with the intention of copying Airbnb, Apple, or Stripe. But they’re such beautifully-designed experiences that it’s hard <em>not</em> to be inspired to some degree — even subconsciously.</p>
<p>Whilst the limitless optionality of a blank Figma board can be overwhelming, the answer is rarely to copy someone else. The plagiarism issue aside, it’s <strong>tough to replicate the magic of another user experience and not lose the magic that makes it work</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Do you actually understand why it’s worked? Have you lost the secret sauce somewhere in the replication? Can you then innovate your own ideas onto them?</em></p>
<p>Firstly, let me give you an example of an industry where it’s been commonplace to copy what works from younger and more agile start-ups: <strong><em>banking</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Today I published some of the findings from a 900-day study of 12 banks in the UK called The <a href="https://builtformars.com/ux-of-banking">UX of Banking</a>. As a lifelong reader of Smashing Mag, I wanted to give you all a modified excerpt from <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/ux-banking-chapter-8">that article</a> and then some advice on <em>how to effectively take inspiration from others</em>.</p>
Monzo Bank Was Heavily Copied In 2020
<p>Back in 2020 (when I started this study), I was critical of how most of the incumbent banks handled basic card management features. They lacked context, the designs themselves were really poor, and there were basic usability issues.</p>
<p>New features, like freezing your card or showing your PIN inside the app, were simply added as new rows — similar to a settings page. This was the predictable risk of adding new functionality for decades without rebalancing the core user experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/copying-designs-doesnt-work/1-mobile-bank-card-management-features.png" /></p>
<p><strong><em>But, unburdened by how things used to be</em></strong>, Monzo, Starling, and Revolut seized the opportunity to design something that felt intuitive for this new paradigm. This example is from the UK, but it’s true of many global brands, like Robinhood, Venmo, N26, and CashApp.</p>
<p>Since 2020, there’s been a noticeable effort to replicate what works inside the UK banking scene, and the experiences are looking very similar.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/copying-designs-doesnt-work/2-monzo-app-design.jpg" /></p>
<p>In particular, the order and positioning of the most common card management features — as shown above on Monzo in 2020. This is what’s clearly been a massive ‘inspiration’ to other banks.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/copying-designs-doesnt-work/3-mobile-bank-visual-design-functional-architecture.png" /></p>
<p>This is true both of the visual aspects of design (i.e., how it looks) and the functional architecture of managing your card (i.e., how it works).</p>
<p>Barclays might have more than 80,000 employees, but it looks like they have the same grey Figma habits as the rest of us.</p>
The Risk Of Copying
<p>Now let me show you an example where copying can get you in trouble: chasing ‘click-parity’, copying a simple flow that you don’t understand, and not considering that often the best experiences are the longest.</p>
<p>Here are the number of clicks it takes to order a new card with each of the 12 banks I’ve been following:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/copying-designs-doesnt-work/4-graph-number-clicks-order-bank-card.png" /></p>
<p>As an analyst (and at first glance), it might look like Metro has the best user journey. But in this instance, the number of clicks is the wrong metric to care about.</p>
<p>There appears to be very little positive correlation between what I believe are the better experiences (e.g., Revolut, Monzo, and Starling) and the number of clicks.</p>
<p>Rather, having too few clicks is more likely to be an <strong>indication that there’s not enough context</strong> (or that it’s crammed into one screen). </p>
<p><strong>It’s almost like the obvious cheat codes of design: use more padding, space things out, and give yourself more room to add context.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s consider a few nuances to this specific user journey (i.e., losing your bank card):</p>
<ul>
<li>📅 <strong>Infrequent usage</strong><br />Most people aren’t ordering new cards every month. So, this isn’t a ‘power feature’, and they’re not hoping to optimize for efficiency.</li>
<li>😰 <strong>Negative connotations</strong><br />Most of the time, you’re ordering a new card due to a negative event (e.g., stolen, lost, or damaged). You’re probably already anxious, stressed, and frustrated.</li>
<li>⌛️ <strong>Time sensitive</strong><br />People need a new card quickly. The context behind delivery speed is important, rather than the speed of <em>ordering</em> the card.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To summarize</strong>: People who’ve lost their card will likely be looking for reassurance and comfort rather than efficiency. That’s the tone of the user journey, and as a designer, you need to be acutely aware of it.</p>
<p>Metro has so few clicks because it’s essentially one screen with two buttons. You have no option to keep the same PIN (say, if you’ve damaged your card at home), which means that you have to wait for both a card and a PIN to arrive.</p>
<p>The two clicks saved by not asking about this preference forced me to wait an additional two days before I could use my card.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/copying-designs-doesnt-work/5-graph-time-have-active-bank-card.png" /></p>
<p>And they’re the two metrics I’d measure success by for this user journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>How good was the experience (qualitative)?</li>
<li>How quickly can they use their card (quantitative)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to copy Revolut’s flow but remove the features your product doesn’t have, that 11-click process might not feel the same.</p>
<p>Or, you could take inspiration from Monzo’s ‘card-selection screen’, but if you’ve combined it with another step they don’t have, you may lose the magic of why it works.</p>
<p>Even banks, who largely have the same feature set, are replicating the same ideas with a really broad quality of execution.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>It’s an industry that should be relatively easy to replicate ideas, but demonstrates how subtly hard it can be.</em></p>
The Do’s And Don’ts Of Implementing Inspiration
<p>To be absolutely clear, I’m an advocate for leaning into the <strong>Familiarity Bias</strong> — a tendency for people to prefer (i.e., choose) products, services, and options that feel familiar to them. </p>
<p>So, here are a few handy <em>do’s</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of building <em>familiar-feeling</em> products, without losing that magic spark:</p>
<p><strong>✅ Things to do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try to identify the <a href="https://builtformars.com/ux-glossary">psychological biases</a> that are in play.</strong><br />Is the user frustrated? Sad? Are they trying to avoid making losses, or is their decision-making skewed by something else? Ultimately, do they resemble the same biases affecting your product?</li>
<li><strong>Can you lean into a well-known mechanism and save some onboarding effort?</strong><br />For example, TikTok popularized the ‘swipe to watch’ mechanism. There’s no shame in using that same navigation style; your users will instantly feel more familiar with your product. Remember: familiarity is a shortcut to learning.</li>
<li><strong>Be inspired by the inventiveness of the execution, not the visual stuff</strong>.<br />It’s not productive to fall in love with Shopify’s checkout process and convince yourself that you need to copy it. Instead, try to identify how they’ve cleverly innovated about subtle and specific problems (i.e., managing global delivery addresses in one page without reloading).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>❌ Things to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t outright copy someone else’s design.</strong><br />You are probably only seeing 5% of the complexity, and the other 95% may include unexpected nuances that led to visible decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t assume that you should have feature parity.</strong><br />In other words, just because a company you admire has features X, Y, and Z in the main nav doesn’t mean you should. <em>What do your users actually want to do?</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t forget that your start-up isn’t Airbnb, and you need to educate people on what you actually do.</strong><br />In other words, when a product becomes a household name, they often don’t need to spend time (i.e., clicks) teaching the user what they actually do — everyone already knows. But you probably do.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t have the silver bullet of successfully replicating the magic of Apple (and if I did, honestly, I’d probably keep it to myself and make a fortune). </p>
<p>But, hopefully, this serves as an important reminder not to follow the competition blindly.</p>

<p></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_"><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/smashing-podcast-episode-55/tejas-kumar-200x200-opt.jpg" /></a> Vitaly Friedman: He has been writing code since the age of eight and still continues to do so today. He’s a DevRel leader, YouTuber, advisor, mentor, influencer, and has very, very strong opinions about pretty much everything.
Previously, he’s worked with G2L, Vercel, Spotify etc picking up things along the way, sometimes as a developer and sometimes as a manager.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Now he lives in Berlin, Germany, but most of the time travels the world equipping and encouraging developers to do their best work, aiming to make the world a better place for quality software. Beyond that, he’s extremely kind, passionate, friendly, and smart. And not that a passes by that him sharing his opinions again on everything Tailwind, JavaScript and people on Twitter. </p>
<p>Vitaly: Now we know he’s a great product engineer and a kind human being, but did you know that he can easily type faster than 100 words per minute when writing code without a single mistake, especially if it’s a life coding session in front of thousands of developers? My smashing friends, please welcome Tejas Kumar. Hello, Tejas. How are you doing today?</p>
<p>Tejas: What’s up? I’m doing good. I’m smashing. I’m smashing things as we speak. I’m also doing smashing.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, well—</p>
<p>Tejas: Smashing enough.</p>
<p>Vitaly: You always look smashing. Always. I always feel smashing when I see you being smashing in some way or the other.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes, that’s what my grandpa always used to say. Smash them with kindness.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, really? Wow. This is just the perfect beginning of the interview. Now it’s so nice to have you here. I remember everything from our strange bus trips to our walks in somewhere between Croatia and Germany, and what not, it’s always so, I don’t know. It’s so much fun to be around because you always have, again, opinions about things.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes.</p>
<p>Vitaly: You always express them with a very strong kindness. Why is that, Tejas? Where is it coming from?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, it comes from a lot. So when I do talks and things at conferences, a lot of people tell me... they come to me after and they’re like, "Hey, that was so genuine. I felt like that was very genuine."
And it comes from that. I’m a strong believer in speaking truth in love or kindly, and I guess that’s where it comes from. I do have strong opinions about things, right, but I feel like they have to come under an umbrella of kindness and respect. Otherwise, nobody wants to listen to some angry person with strong opinions who’s not friendly.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, you don’t know. I mean, I’m very happy to hear maybe not angry people, but like whenever someone has a very strong opinion, I’m totally fine with that. Actually, there is Lex Friedman, who is a podcaster. He’s doing all these videos with people on YouTube like you do as well. We’ll talk about it in a moment. But he had just posted recently one thing. He applauded to all the people who are attentive enough to listen to other people’s opinions and their arguments and be willing to change their minds.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So I think that if you have a very strong opinion about things, as long as you are willing and open minded to change your mind based on the arguments that come your way, right? I think this is fine for me. This is actually a very important skill to have.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes. Yes. I think the underlying skill there is critical thinking and being open and receptive. 100%. I was just watching the Welcome to Chippendales. I don’t know if you’ve heard of this show, right?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Not yet, no.</p>
<p>Tejas: It’s a great show. I can recommend it. And in that show you watch the founder of Chippendales repeatedly screw up his company and go into bankruptcy. And the common thread in his mistakes is that he just has a lot of this entrenched, close minded pridefulness where he refuses to have his mind changed despite his strong opinions.
So I agree with you. I think that’s something I try. I work hard at and try to maintain, and so I appreciate that you called it out here on this conversation.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, sure. Well, the reason why I wanted to have you on the show as well, because you have all these incredible experiences and stories you can share, right? And you also are very public about things that are important to you and you’re not afraid of strong words as well by doing so. And so maybe just for everybody to be kind of following your story to know who you are and what you’re coming from and so on, maybe you could just share a little bit of insight about how did you end up in this front end madness? Where is it coming from?
Did you wake up one day when you were eight and thought, "This is it. I went to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript for living now for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>Tejas: When I was eight years old, react was actually a thing. I’m joking. It wasn't.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, who knows? Who knows?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah. No, but yeah, no, I was born with a disease that was really limiting and there’s a lot of things I couldn’t do. I had a ton of physical limitations. I made a whole 48 minute YouTube video about it, which you can watch if you’re more just interested or we could talk about it here. I don’t really care. But with the limitations I had, I couldn’t go to school every day. I couldn’t carry a backpack. I couldn’t open doors. I couldn’t walk upstairs. I couldn’t do a lot of things. The only thing I could do was take my fingers and type on keyboards with them. And thankfully my family was relatively low income at the time. I grew up quite poor, but we had just enough privilege to where we had a computer and a keyboard. And since this was the only thing I could do in many ways I feel like coding found me. And I was drawn to, I have a YouTube video coming about this coming out about this on Thursday, I was drawn to the quick feedback loop of JavaScript where you just write a little bit of code in your browsers console and it executes. And I was like, whoa. And it’s that kind of whoa, that kind of I found when I was eight just kind of playing with browsers and code. And it’s the same whoa that I chased today.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s interesting. So would you say that this was specifically then JavaScript that kind of spoke to you, or would you say that this just, if Flash was still a thing it’d still be running around building Flash websites?</p>
<p>Tejas: That’s an excellent question. No, it’s definitely not JavaScript at all. It was, well, it started with Photoshop, so I was-</p>
<p>Vitaly: Photoshop. What is Photoshop, Tejas?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, I know, right? Nowadays with Figma and stuff, Photoshop’s a bit lost, but when I was young, Photoshop was the design tool. It wasn’t just for photo editing and manipulation, it was for at least I used it for creating stuff because Vector wasn’t so recommended at the time. And so when I was younger, Vitaly, we had Macro S Factor.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Even younger.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah?</p>
<p>Vitaly: Even younger.</p>
<p>Tejas: No, no, not even younger. When I was younger than I am now. When I was kind of just getting into it, Mac OS Aqua, the design principle aqua thing, was very in vogue and everybody was trying to design these shiny balls.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I remember them vividly, yeah, yeah. I remember.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah. The shiny balls. And so I did tutorials on Photoshop. I was like, I want to make a really shiny ball. And then from there I moved to Tux. They made these penguins with gloss effects, and that’s where I started and I was like, wow, this is so beautiful. And then I found the slicing tool where I could design something and make it html, and I was like, whoa. And then I was like, okay, this is cool, but how do I make it interactive? And then I found JavaScript. So the draw was really creating stuff without any physical damage to myself and without any financial requirement. I was able to create stuff without any barriers to entry other than the crappy old keyboard and computer we had. So that was it.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, the magic thing for me was really this moment when I realized that I can actually make it available to everybody else. That was that magic thing. I mean, I remember FTPing all the way, and—</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean there were plenty of free servers out there with all the kind of advertising and all of that. And I was just, wow, there are 12 people who visited my website in the last three months. It was incredible. That was just really mind changing, like mind blowing, life changing for me. Yeah, that’s really incredible. And if I look at the industry now, the industry is so mature. There are so many incredible things. Like the thing that we’re building on the internet, on the web, it’s just unbelievable. It’s just the level of software engineering and all.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah but you know, Vitaly, I feel a bit sad that it’s so mature now that it’s ... when I was younger, not younger than when I started ...</p>
<p>Vitaly: I assumed that, yeah.</p>
<p>Tejas: As I was growing, I’ll put it this way, I was often terrified of being a mature adult because when I was younger and rebellious, being mature was being boring for me. I was like, oh, I have to put on a suit and tie and kind of be bored. Like my childlike wonder was lost in my definition of maturity many years ago. And I liken that to today.
You say the web is mature and I agree with you. It kind of makes me sad because I feel like in this maturity we’ve lost a lot of the awesome whimsy that we used to have. I don’t know if you remember these Geo cities, angel fire type of websites with under construction banner and like all of, you know?</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean, you can still have them on the web. It’s just not many people do.</p>
<p>Tejas: Right. But it’s because it’s not cool anymore. And I want to bring that back. I remember the dancing baby for no ... like every website just had a dancing baby and a cursor that was a clock that would follow your cursor. Anyways, so all of this I feel like we’ve lost, and I’d like to see more of that. Anyway, sorry. Just a little rant.</p>
<p>Vitaly: No, I think that’s actually, in many ways, it’s like we’re always moving in circles. I have a very strong feeling that in many ways when I look at e-commerce websites, you probably don’t want to have it there necessarily unless it's, I don’t know. Maybe it’s a brand with a personality and things like that. That might be okay. But I do feel like we are a little bit too used to getting things done in a certain way. And I mean, very often we think about we have to be conventional. We need to follow particular guidelines and rules. And we probably should if you want to be conventional and we want to follow the rules and want things to be familiar to everyone.
But I mean, there’s also this notion of surprising people, and I’m not talking about delight necessarily, but just surprising them. Just making them think a little bit about where they are and what they’re doing. I mean, if I look at your website, well every time I come to the site for some reason I see a slightly different and sometimes slightly strange photo of yourself. Sometimes in very different outfits.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So is that the whimsical that you are kind of mentioning there? Speaking about?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, yeah. If you drag your cursor, if you move your cursor around, you just cycle through a bunch of random photos of me. It’s open source. So I’ve lost control of ... so people will add pictures of me dressed as a flower, pictures of some muscular guy.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Look fantastic as a flower, if I may say.</p>
<p>Tejas: So. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, they’ll do some muscular guy shirtless with just my face photoshopped on him. They’ll do all kinds of weird things.
This is not me, this is the community who feel the need to add weird pictures of me on my website. But it’s exactly the whimsy I’m talking about. And as you drag your cursor across, you’ll see some of these. And I like that. And I feel like, to your point, smashing does the perfect balance of this with the cats. The cats are not ... like if you’re talking about content and great content, great tips, great, whatever smashing does, the cats are really non-essential. But I feel like they are essential because they bring that awesome whimsy. So I like that y'all do that as well. I think it’s much needed.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. So I think we do like cats. I mean it’s been quite a journey with all the cats. I mean, I don’t even know where they have been and have not been at this point, right?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But also speaking about you, where you have been and where you have not been yet. I mean you’ve been working on so many different really cool companies. I mean, I look at Vercel, Spotify, Xata recently, right?
Maybe, I don’t know if you could share some insights about what did you learn from each of those things? Maybe there was some really interesting insights that you wish you’d known earlier in your career.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, definitely. I was just talking to my good friend Fabian. I just had lunch with him and he mentioned he’s reading this book by an ex-Google engineer called Solve for Happy. Great book. And in that book he talks about how really nothing is really good or bad or happy or sad. It’s just what’s our perception of it. And I feel this way about the jobs that I’ve left because there’s lessons in there from each of them. Most recently from Zeta, I learned the, actually from Zeta and G2I, both of these companies combined, I’ve learned the value and importance of urgency, ownership and autonomy. I think that’s really important.</p>
<p>Tejas: In fact, there’s an old Steve Jobs interview when he was much younger. He had hair and was alive, but he said people tend to leave when they feel like they can’t have ideas. And I saw that, I saw it executed very, very well at G2I where I was reporting to the CTO. And he was just like, he would talk to me on Monday and ask me what my plan is. We’d align and he’d be like, "Awesome, make it happen. Goodbye. Come to me if you need anything, but I trust you."
And this phrase, "I trust you." I learned how powerful that can be in a position of leadership. And then I would continue to have multiple management leadership roles there, even as director of developer relations at Zeta. And that’s something I carried with me from G2I was this, “I trust you. Make it happen.” So I would talk to my team on Monday. We’d kind of plan for the week and then by Friday, well on Monday I would tell them, I would say, "See you Friday. Come to me if you need anything, but I trust you." And then we’d go to Friday where we would have just an end of week, what did we do, how do we feel check in. And this was excellent. We came up with this really nice rhythm that facilitated this kind of urgency and ownership without stress, urgency without stress. It was really, really nice.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I mean, one thing that I noticed recently is that many companies try to be very careful about how, on the one hand, to give people this sort of autonomy to just trust them and do the work. Because again, when you think about micromanagement, it’s such a bad kind of really bad pattern to use. And I mean there are probably plenty of companies that are still my micromanaging on some level. But I think there is this way of crystallizing, I guess in some way, those things that really work and things that do not work.
One thing that I saw companies were using, and it works seems to be working really well. This idea of, maybe you’ve heard about this as well, is the idea as a manual for me.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That means, for example, where you say, okay, every single individual contributor or anybody, manager. It doesn’t matter really. Every single person who is working in the company, you better go ahead and try to prepare a little Google Doc on Notion document or anything like that where you describe how do you work comfortably, what is important to you, like your calendar, your preferences, when do you work best? So is it okay to disturb you in the morning? Is it better to disturb you slightly later when it comes to an urgent meeting or things like that. And so everybody’s encouraged to create this as long as it can be a mural board or mural board or anything like that. And so everybody’s encouraged then to put the link to it in their Slack profile. And so everybody knows, okay, I don’t know who that person is. And especially in a big corporation, a big company, we have maybe tens of thousands of people working.</p>
<p>Vitaly: It might be very, very comfortable to be able to say, okay, I need to reach out to that person, that position from the team, but I don’t want to come across as in kind of pushing my ideas or whatever I want through their agenda in some way the other disrupting them. But I wanted to be more respectful. So that was really magical when I saw that and I thought, wow, I really appreciate it, especially in the remote first environment that where we are working.</p>
<p>Tejas: We did that at G2I as well. We had social contracts, they were called. These documents. And I remember them working really, really well.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Would you say that for your perspective would you... now I assume that you are looking, I don’t know, either maybe building something on your own, maybe kind looking what’s around and all. Is it important for you that you’re working remote first, remote only, or would you say that’s not a problem for me to go to the office every day?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, it depends. It really depends on a number of factors. I could honestly make the office thing work if the other factors were appropriate. But, yeah, no, I don’t think remote’s a hard line for me.
I was, again, to cite my friend Fabian. I asked him the same question. I said, "Do you prefer remote or onsite?" And his response was a third option, which he tends to think outside the box. He is like, well, honestly, I prefer a choice. Being able to do a remote for a season and then onsite for a season. Like the choice is the magic to him. And I kind of agree with that. But I could do office if it’s required for sure.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But also looking in general at the IT industry, I know with a big eye and a big T, I guess at this point there is a lot of stuff going on and many people are concerned layoffs, and there isn’t a sense of uncertainty about where we’re going with ... Is it still a thing to be a project engineer? Is it a good thing to be a project engineer? I’m pretty sure it is, right? But where do you see all of this kind of being today? Is it just a natural way of the economy is not in a good shape, so sure there are layoffs after a season of hiring, or do you see this kind of becoming a trend where we have to be careful and cautious about not losing our jobs for AI by any means? What’s the take on this?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, my take on this is it’s normal. I feel like look at the GDP curve of any country of any year and you’ll see is dips recessions are normal and predictable and they happen. And when recessions happen, layoffs happen. I feel like a recession is a sign of economic normalcy. If it lasts very long, then it’s a depression. That’s a huge problem. But I feel like it’s expected. I feel like layoffs unfortunately have their time and place. They’re not good. They affect families. I mean, I had the privilege of quitting, but I also feel the squeeze of unemployment. So I don’t think they’re good. But I think it happens. I don’t think the jobs will be taken by machines yet because machines and AI is being designed now to kind of be a helper.</p>
<p>Tejas: So I feel like it’ll help us. But I do think you give chat GPT, access to the internet, which it doesn’t have, and then it gets extra superpowers and gets more threatening. But I feel like there’s human beings with a vested interest in preserving human beings with jobs. So I’m not so sure the AI will take our jobs, but the state of the industry now I think is actually pretty cool, Vitaly, because when you and I started and I mean you probably started way before me, so I’ll just say when I started. I’m not calling you old. I’m just calling you experience.</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s okay. That’s okay. We’re all friends here.</p>
<p>Tejas: No, but when I started, there was no front end and backend. There was webmaster. There was a web dev and it was the one guy or girl who would design, develop, and then drag things over to the FTP thing to upload to some shared hosts. Some of this is quite common.
But then over time you and I have had the privilege of watching higher specializations develop. So we went from webmaster to now front end and backend to DevOps. And then from that to now machine learning engineers, data scientists, and then an emerging part of this is DevRel, is developer relations, I feel like is still pretty young, but I think the industry has kind of a tree root with branches, has kind of branched off into specializations and I see more of them occurring.</p>
<p>Tejas: And I think it’s pretty great because that means more options for people to get jobs to maybe start at an abstract level, but I think it’s better for humanity. One fear of mine is that the world is becoming, the tech industry is taking over the world, right? We used to have clothing stores, now we have online companies that sell clothes. We used to have travel agents, now we have websites that sell tickets. Like everything’s becoming tech. And this is part of the reason why I used to have strong opinions. This is part of the reason why I campaign really hard for diversity, equality and inclusion because Plan A was heavily unequal of the world, so to speak.</p>
<p>Tejas: I watched a documentary on Columbus yesterday and made me hate the world a little bit more, right? And so I feel like if we’re undergoing some type of tech revolution where more companies are tech companies advocating for fairness, equality, diversity and inclusion is massively important so that people don’t get left out and equality doesn’t get as skew as it has been historically.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think it’s also this notion in general of I think us focusing a bit too much on speed. I remember vividly having this conversation a while back about, "Oh wow, the technology is moving fast, so fast and we’re going to do less, which is going to do less because the technology is going to take over." It’s the same way we see AI now like oh ChatGPT can do so much. It can be giving us answers, better answers, faster answers, and—</p>
<p>Tejas: Can write code.</p>
<p>Vitaly: You can actually quote ... yeah, you can write code, it can debug and everything. So we are going to do less. But I think that reality, I mean at least in my life so far it has been very different. It becomes faster, but then we tend to do much more. We always find a way to fill in not necessarily the gaps, because these gaps don’t even have a chance to appear, right? We are just moving. It’s like it’s everything. I have the strong feeling in the past. Maybe it’s kind of similar to you as well, maybe not. I have a feeling that I was doing one thing and I was doing it interruptedly, and then I would spend two, three hours on that and I would be kind of done more or less. Now it seems like, well, maybe 23 things. And yeah, we don’t do them in peril. I don’t really believe in multitasking or maybe I’m just really bad at multitasking while other people are much better. But I do have a strong feeling that it’s all so fragmented and we do so many different things at the same time. And so I don’t believe that technology is making us redundant in any way. It’s just we are doing certain different things, right?</p>
<p>Tejas: Exactly.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But talking about that, one thing I do have to ask because we probably, I expect probably can hear the voices in the back asking, "Tejas, what about those frameworks and front? Let’s talk about phone time landscape in 2023." And one question that people ask me, and I want you to answer it is, we came from times when Jake worry was a big thing and it still is a big thing on many websites and legacy website and many websites in general. Do you expect this world of frameworks to change or are we at some level of maturity where a react is going to stay, view is going to stay, angle is going to stay? I mean, it’s impossible to answer that. That’s why I’m asking you now. What’s your take on this in general? Should we be talking ... like imagine 20 years from now we’re sitting in a podcast like this thinking, "Remember when React was a thing and look now?"</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, you say 20 years, I feel like one year from now someone’s going to listen to this and be like, "Oh my gosh, this stage Tejas was so wrong about his answer."</p>
<p>Tejas: No. So I think first of all, I think the web is held up by giants who are underappreciated. And by that I mean specifically jQuery and WordPress power more of the internet than React period.
So a lot of them people talk about, "Oh, they’re not cool." No, no, they power most of the internet and I think they should be acknowledged. But there was a time in the React story where React had enough momentum and critical mass to look cooler than jQuery.
It’s the new thing, it’s the new industry standard. And then jQuery kind of got diminished even though it’s usage didn’t, but it’s I guess perceived value got diminished and reacted over.
And I think in 2023 we’re starting to see some of that as well with React. Where React is used a lot. I mean I just put out a YouTube video about why React is unbeatable. And I do think it is unbeatable because here’s the deal: jQuery and WordPress have not been beaten.</p>
<p>Tejas: They’re also unbeatable to some degree. And now especially you have teams at Google investing in React, investing in how React works in Chrome, et cetera. So I think React is here to stay, but I think it’s perceived value is diminishing in 2023. And I feel like it will diminish further with the advent of awesome tools like Quick and solid specifically.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right, right.</p>
<p>Tejas: And, of course, View and Svelt and Angular are around, so I think they’ll all stay. It’s always looking for this newer shinier thing. The big appeal, right, with the newer stuff with Solid and Quick is that they don’t ship a whole virtual dom implementation to the browser, which is heavy and slow. So React is objectively slower and heavier than Solid and Quick. And so there’s two sides, now it’s divided. Some would say, okay, but it’s just milliseconds. They don’t matter that much. It’s not true. It’s been proven by Google, by Chrome, that milliseconds make millions. And so I do think React is seeing its decline, maybe not in usage but in the popular vote in 2023.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But at the same time also see that there are all this kind of fine tuning almost coming in where, I don’t know when was that? I can’t track drug time anymore. But five, 10 years ago, oh, we have React and we have this full client side thing and off we go.
But then now when we can run React on the server, we can now be a bit more clever I guess, about what is going to happen on the server, how much of it do we need to ship to the client and when and when not, and all those things.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think this is, in many ways we moved away from this notion of let’s have one single React application to let’s have, I don’t know, hundreds. Every single component we have might be a single standalone React application with its own life cycle and all that.
And it kind of really changes it. But I also think that, I don’t know, I learned that’s probably, there is no way to know for sure. So maybe just tomorrow there will be somebody coming up with a chat GPT query and this is going to take over both J query and also React. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Do you feel like something like ChatGPTQuery it could exist or help us in some way? Like bending in body and making, I don’t know what can I do everything.</p>
<p>Tejas: I would be interested to ask chat GPT to write code for the best fastest UI library on earth. See what it comes up with. But on a more serious note, I feel like a big contributor to this shift from we’re doing things on the client to we’re doing things on the server that then influences the development of React and Solid and all the others to be more server oriented is these serverless platforms - Versa, Netlify, CloudFlare. These platforms have led to what I’m calling server liberation. Like nobody server rendered before, Veril, Netlify, CloudFlare, et cetera. Because servers were inaccessible. They were hard to configure for client side apps. You would need to do a rewrite on a 404 to go to your index or HTML so you can download the client.</p>
<p>Tejas: It was very complicated. And then these companies stepped in there like, “Hey wait, we’ll make servers easy.” And then if deploying a node server is easy, now you’re like, “Oh, now I can render on the server.” And so they kind of unlocked this. So I feel like if we want to predict where the libraries and frameworks will go next, we can kind of look at what is the adjacent surrounding supporting tech that would lead them. And I think that’s kind of a good indicator. But I’m not in a position to make such predictions accurately.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well of course you are. Of course you are. You’re here on a podcast. You can predict anything, you can see the future. I’m sure you’ve seen it. So here we go. You can definitely report on that. But also moving maybe to slightly different topic, just to explore the landscape. I always fascinated by this feeling of community and by this feeling of bringing people together, the conferences, and we’ve been running conferences for many years now. And you’ve been to so many conferences as well, and I heard rumors, and maybe they’re not true, but I don’t know. I heard rumors that you might even be thinking about setting up a conference one day?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, I’m actually starting ContagiousCon. It’s where everybody comes together and tells me how much they like me.</p>
<p>Vitaly: It’s like a contaga of the SmashingConfs. Thank you for that. But, dude, I’ve been to so many conferences, experienced so many things that I’ve kind of developed an intuition for what attendees want, what speakers want, and the pains that organizer. I’ve spoken to Charis also the pains that organizers have to deal with.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And so bringing this triquetra of experiences, kind of working in coordination with the organizers to provide something very rich for people. I think that’s something that I’m very excited for. Also connecting organizers to sponsors. A lot of conferences don’t have the privilege of money and with the amount of companies I talk to and et cetera, it looks like connecting the right sponsors to the right conferences for the best experience for attendees really. Right. But do you feel like we are at this point where in-person conferences are back for good?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah. It feels like different parts of the world maybe, I don’t know, maybe it’s just me. Things a little bit slower. But I do know for sure is that there is this sense of enough of online stuff. We do so much stuff online anyway. If we do something then we do it in person. Now you having attended so many conferences last year, I think both virtually and in person, would you say that kind of online conferences are here to stay? There are still plenty of them around. We had to do it for a while and now we’re probably going to keep it as a live livestream in addition to an in-person? Or is it a good replacement still?</p>
<p>Tejas: I don’t think it’s a good replacement. Nothing will ever replace face-to-face interactions. I said, I’m not in a position to make predictions about front end stuff. I can make 100% an accurate prediction about this. Nothing will ever replace an in-person interaction face-to-face. No screen can substitute a warm flesh and blood person in front of you. And so I think in-person is here to stay, but a lot of companies and organization teams have invested time and money into getting the online part, right? That why should we throw it away? We have it now.</p>
<p>Tejas: So I feel like it will be a fallback and a second track, as it were. And it’s not bad for business. You can sell a lot of tickets by volume for just some livestream and people will join. And I think it’s good because there’s people who can’t travel that you get to include now, right? So it’s good. So yeah, I think that’s the future is in person, but also virtual.</p>
<p>Vitaly: What is your future though? So I mean, I’m very curious. You always have these ideas of things you want to do in general. I mean, again, having learned so much from all the different companies. There must have been some things that where you said to yourself, "Okay, I would’ve done it differently."</p>
<p>Tejas: Oh man, you can’t imagine.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, yeah, please go ahead. I’m very curious to hear that.</p>
<p>Tejas: I’ve been in positions where I’ve been micromanaged to death, right, and I’m very, I look back at those and go like, oh my gosh, I would do this so differently the way I’ve done it by not micromanaging people. I think that’s probably the strongest one.
But also conferences. I’ve seen conferences do things wrong. I think the biggest mistake I’ve seen there is overselling. They’ll show you a venue that’s packed full of sunlight and everything and you get there and it’s just someone’s dark basement.</p>
<p>Vitaly: There is no sunlight.</p>
<p>Tejas: No, yeah, they turn off the sun for this one conference. So I’ve seen conferences that will just not record talks and they won’t tell you ahead of time. So I think the biggest mistake conference organizers have made is a lack of communication about important things. I want to know if I’m not going to be recorded, so then I don’t make the effort of going there. Because a big draw is this thing’s going to be recorded and visible for everybody after. And some conferences have made it known not at all that your thing’s not recorded and then months go by and you’re like, where’s that video? Oh, they didn’t record it. Oh no.</p>
<p>Tejas: So I would do those things differently, but what’s next for me? It’s funny you ask literally, because it’s a new year and I’ve dedicated this week, so I’m unemployed in case listeners are unaware.
And I’ve started to feel the squeeze of being unemployed, put it that way. And I don’t know what’s next. I’ve decided to take this week and figure it out. I think I do want to spend time creating YouTube content because I like communicating with people and reaching people and really, yeah, this will sound a bit narcissistic, but blessing them with whatever I can bless them with. So I think YouTube is one thing I want to keep. But really, I don’t know, man, do I join a company as an employee? Do I start my own company? Do I just remain a freelancer? I don’t know.
So I’m taking this week to talk to good friends and have them speak into my life and give me the best advice, who know me well. I’m currently leaning more towards starting a... I can’t say a company for legal reasons, but starting a type of company.</p>
<p>Vitaly: And enterprise.</p>
<p>Tejas: Sure, yes. Start starting an enterprises. Starting an enterprise somewhere around DevRel. That seems really attractive to me. And really you are an inspiration for that. Watching you lead smashing, right?
I want to be able to do that. To give people a place where they can be creative and do their best work, et cetera, while also earning a good amount of money. I want to create something like that. So I’m kind of leaning towards that. I don’t know if it’s sustainable or if I’m skilled enough to do that, but that’s kind of ... Plan B, listen to this privilege. Vitaly, listen to how ridiculous this sounds.</p>
<p>Tejas: My worst case scenario, my like fallback is I get a job at some tech company and earn a decent salary. That’s unbelievable. But that’s kind of plan B is just take a job somewhere. Of course, it would have to be in a field I’m passionate about, that I care about, et cetera. But yeah, that’s kind of where I’m at.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Where would you see yourself in general? I mean there are many companies, many people who are trying to get to the fan club, the big ones, the Facebook, the Apple, the Google, the Amazon and so on so forth.
Did you ever think about, okay, I’m going to do whatever is needed? And I know that, again, looking that you started coding back when you were eight, right? And you’re a software engineer.
I assume that that might be on your agenda to get to this top five, top 10 other companies on the world. Is it interesting to you or would you rather work in a smaller company?</p>
<p>Tejas: That’s a great question. Yeah, so it was interesting. I feel like the closest I’ve got to big company energy is Spotify. And just by virtue of working at Spotify with 4,000 employees, I learned very quickly that this isn’t for me. So maybe, but I’m leaning more towards, no, with the larger tech empire-type companies. I feel like it would be great if I had three children in a very busy personal life to go to work and kind of have that much structure and rigidity. But at this point in life it’s a no for me.</p>
<p>Vitaly: I think it’s interesting because I’m being asked that as well. And actually I was under a very strong impression at some point in my life when I was thinking that if I want to make a good career, I have to work in one of the big ones. I have to do whatever it takes.
But you know me a little bit. I like my freedom and I don’t want to be sitting day and night working or anything. I mean the work-life balance and I mean everybody’s talking more or less about work-life balance. But I mean it in a very ... it’s been hard to explain in a very personal way. Meaning I want to be able to say to myself, and this is kind of the ultimate test that I put for myself.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Never want to be in a position where at 2:00 PM on any given day, I have to tell me myself, "Okay, I don’t want to do this and I have to, no matter what it takes, I have to do it for the next four hours, whatever it takes." And I kind of always wanted to be in a position to say, okay, you know what? I’m going to go to cinema at 10:00 AM on Monday morning. Frankly, if I’m being very honest, it really never happened to me that I actually wanted that. And it never really happened to me that I made it or I did it. But I mean, this kind of sense of freedom is very important here, but not everybody can afford that. And it’s a lot of risk too.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, it’s also an emerging trend in the industry. Zeta works this way when I was there at least. It’s more results-based than time-based. So on paper you have a 40 hour kind of work week, but you distribute those 40 hours. However, you could do two days straight and then the next day go to a movie theater in the morning. So they don’t care about when you work, it’s just that stuff gets done. I see that. That happens with full-time employment too. I feel like with the fan club, everyone I talked to at fan companies. My own experience at Spotify was, and this is not to speak ill of these companies, there are big companies with lots of things happening.
There’s a lot of meetings, a lot of meetings to where you will have a meeting blocked-</p>
<p>Vitaly: And you don’t like meetings.</p>
<p>Tejas: Me? I like meetings, but I feel like look, too much of any good thing becomes a bad thing. And I feel like, respectfully, Spotify when I was there, had too many meetings. It did. And it’s not their fault. There was a pandemic and they’re used to working in office. They were not remote ever. So the pandemic made them go remote. But then there was a lot of learning to do about how to be remote. And I joined just in the middle of that where async meetings were not really a thing and it was very complicated. And so I was just at my laptop all day in video calls because it’s kind of being in an office.</p>
<p>Tejas: So no, I didn’t enjoy the meetings. And I found not just me, but I have friends at Google, at Meta, they’ll accidentally around me be like, “Hey, look at my phone.” And they’ll show me a photo from their vacation, and I see notifications pop up, “Oh, you have meeting at 10 minutes?” And they tap on the notification, go to the calendar app and “Oh my God, the carnage in this calendar app.” You look at that once you’re like, okay, I do not envy you. So—</p>
<p>Vitaly: Yeah, I mean surely meetings are necessary, but it’s also a matter of how to organize it because for me, or for us and at Smashing for example, we don’t have many meetings. But also, most importantly, everybody can set boundaries in a way. So I like to have, for example, like for this call, right? I like to have two or three days blocked out when there are no meetings.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes.</p>
<p>Vitaly: No meetings. Just almost, I mean, something must happen, something bad, or too good must happen for the day to have a meeting, right? And it’s also really just about having proper boundaries in place of this is when we work, and this is when we have meetings. Although of course meetings also work.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah. One lesson I learned working at so many different places is people. I say people because I know people, but even just speaking of myself, people suck at creating good and healthy boundaries in the workplace. I do. I did more when I was more inexperienced, but still it’s a struggle to have good, strong boundaries. I feel like it could work better if the employer enforced and enabled people to think more about boundaries and even suggested, “Hey, maybe you should do a no meeting day.”</p>
<p>Tejas: If managers push, not push boundaries, but how do you say? Establish boundaries on behalf of their people. Yeah, and that’s something I’d like to see more of. I haven’t seen the opposite. I’ve seen the lack of people’s ability to set boundaries be exploited far more often than I’ve seen healthy boundary setting from the top.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Right. Well, now I do have to ask though, I’m just curious at this point, do you then have a dream project that you’d like to work on one day, maybe, I don’t know, be building a, I don’t know, some sort of software for rocket ship or anything? Do you have any particular ambitions in that regard?</p>
<p>Tejas: I’m really thankful, Vitaly, to say that this year I’m actually spending all of my unemployed time working on three dream projects of my own. One of them is a secret. I can’t tell you about that.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Oh, come on. Just give us a little of a spoiler then.</p>
<p>Tejas: It’s a very social thing. There is the spoiler. But the other one is working on this DevRel startup co consultancy thing. I’m thinking of starting is the second one. And that’s really excited about that. Worst case, it fails and then I join a company as it were. But that’s something I’m excited about. And the third dream project is my YouTube channel, which I’ve wanted to be a YouTuber for years, mainly honestly, because I like reaching people, but also I’ve speaking about this Mac OS 10 Aqua Ball thing. I get to do that with video, create beautiful videos, and I’m really into cameras and making nice shots and everything. And that’s a cool project. It’s a dream project actually to be a good YouTuber, emphasis on the good because I don’t want to be an average YouTuber. And also to be able to turn it into a living. I feel like my dream would be to just kind of be a full-time YouTuber. Yeah.</p>
<p>Vitaly: But what about TikTok? We don’t see you on TikTok yet.</p>
<p>Tejas: Yeah, sadly. I’m not so good at dances.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Well, maybe that should be the next skill to learn.</p>
<p>Tejas: That could be my New Year’s resolution. Get good at shuffling. Every day I’m shuffling.</p>
<p>Vitaly: So we’ve been learning a little bit about front end and JavaScript and AI and the other companies and so on, but what have you been learning about lately, Tejas? What have you been reading or kind of the skill that you’ve been trying to get acquainted with recently?</p>
<p>Tejas: That’s a good question. For me, communication is probably the thing that I enjoy the most based on conference speaking and stuff. And one thing I’ve been learning is the difference in mode of communication.
What I mean by that is like what makes a great in-person conference talk does not actually make a great YouTube video. And I find this fascinating that when it’s a different modality of communication, people have different preferences. So like what I mean by that is if I come out at Smashing Conf New York or Freiburg, and I’m on stage and I’m like, "What’s up everybody?" High energy. People are like, wow, that’s awesome. But if I do the same thing on YouTube, they’re like, dude, what are you on? And that’s something I’ve been learning how to communicate effectively on different platforms. I’ve yet to learn the TikTok one, but I think it’s mostly through dance.</p>
<p>Vitaly: You’ll get there. I have no doubt about that. All right. Well if you, dear listener, would like to hear more from Tejas you can find him on Twitter where he’s at Tejas Kumar underscore.
We’ll probably have to have another call about why underscore. By the way, why underscore?</p>
<p>Tejas: Because the other one was taken. You know what—</p>
<p>Vitaly: That’s reasonable.</p>
<p>Tejas: If that Tejas could delete their handle and then email me I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p>Vitaly: Excellent. So that would be Tejas Kuma underscore. On YouTube where he’s just at Contagious K and potentially on TikTok, where he’s going to show his best dance moves and tips around Svelt and React eventually. But also on his website, Teg.as Where-</p>
<p>Tejas: T E J</p>
<p>Vitaly: T E J. Yes, indeed. T E J dot, yes. You can also find plenty of photos of Tejas as well. Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tejas.
Do you have any parting words of wisdom you’d like to send to the universe for people who are going to watch us 20 years from now?</p>
<p>Tejas: Yes. I would say this: kindness and compassion is the most important.</p>

Then, we can broaden the selector to target one or more siblings or children. By considering element states or positions, we can style nearly any combination of elements as unique singles or ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>At present, support for <code>:has()</code> is rising, with it being available as of Safari 15.4 and Chrome/Edge 105. It is also behind a flag in Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771896">as of version 103</a>.

How <code>:has()</code> Works With Combinators And Pseudo-Classes
<p>To best understand how the advanced selectors we’ll be creating work, we’ll quickly review the most relevant combinators and pseudo-classes.</p>
<p>A “combinator” is a special character that denotes the type of relationship between selector parts. Here are the core combinators to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>space character: the <strong>descendent combinator</strong> matches a direct or nested child;</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code>: the <strong>direct child combinator</strong> matches only top-level, un-nested children;</li>
<li><code>+</code>: the <strong>adjacent sibling combinator</strong> matches only the very next sibling;</li>
<li><code>~</code>: the <strong>general sibling combinator</strong> matches one or more siblings following the base selector.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first stage of creating complex selectors is to append a pseudo-class to one or more parts. A “pseudo-class” defines a special state of an element, like <code>:hover</code>, and has the format of a single colon followed by the name. The <code>:has()</code> pseudo-class is considered functional since it accepts a parameter. Specifically, it accepts a list of selectors, whether they be simple like <code>img</code> or complex with combinators like <code>img + p</code>.</p>
<p>However, <code>:has()</code> is one of four functional pseudo-classes, with the others being <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, and <code>:not()</code>. Each of them accepts a selector list with a few other unique features.</p>
<p>If you’ve already used <code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code>, it’s likely been to manage specificity. Using <code>:is()</code> means the selector in the list with the highest specificity gives the entire selector its weight. While using <code>:where()</code> lends the entire selector list zero-specificity, making it easily overruled by later rules in the cascade.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code> have the extra special ability to be forgiving selectors. This means you may include (purposely or not) selectors the browser doesn’t understand, and it will still process the parts it does understand. Without this forgiving behavior, the browser would discard the entire rule.</p>
<p>The other benefit of both <code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code> is to create succinct, complex selectors. This is especially handy when using combinators and affecting multiple siblings or descendants, for example, <code>article :is(h1, h2, h3)</code>.</p>
<p>Our last pseudo-class, <code>:not()</code>, has been available in CSS for the longest. However, alongside Selectors Level 4 when <code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code> were released, <code>:not()</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#negation">was enhanced</a>. This happened when it was allowed to accept a list of selectors instead of a single selector. It also has the same specificity behavior noted for <code>:is()</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to know about an underused, incredibly powerful feature of <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, and <code>:not()</code> that we’ll be using to make our advanced <code>:has()</code> selectors. Using the <code>*</code> character within these selectors — which <em>normally</em> in CSS is the “universal selector” — actually refers to the selector target. This allows checking the preceding siblings or ancestors of the selector target. So, in <code>img:not(h1 + *)</code>, we’re selecting images that <em>do not</em> directly follow an <code>h1</code>. And in <code>p:is(h2 + *)</code>, we’re selecting paragraphs <em>only if</em> they directly follow <code>h2</code>. We’ll be using this behavior for our first demo next.</p>
Polyfill For <code>:only-of-selector</code>
<p>While <code>:only-of-type</code> is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:only-of-type">a valid pseudo-class</a>, it only works to select within elements of the same element type. Given <code>.highlight:only-of-type</code>, no matches would be made in the following HTML because the class has no effect on reducing the scope.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Not highlighted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="highlight"&gt;.highlight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not highlighted&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If there was only one paragraph with the <code>highlight</code> class within a parent, it might falsely appear to be working. But in that case, it’s because the root element type the class is attached to is a paragraph, so it matches as true since there are no sibling paragraphs.</p>
<p>By combining <code>:has()</code> and <code>:not()</code>, we can effectively create an <code>:only-of-selector</code> that will match a singleton within a range of siblings based on a class or other valid selector.</p>
<p>We ultimately want our selector to match when there are no matching siblings that exist <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> the target.</p>
<p>A strength of <code>:has()</code> is testing for what follows an element. Since we want to test any number of siblings that follow, we’ll use the general sibling combinator <code>~</code> to create the first condition.</p>
<pre><code>.highlight:not(:has(~ .highlight)
</code></pre>

<p>So far, this gives us the match of “highlights that <em>do not have</em> sibling highlights following it.”</p>
<p>Now we need to check prior siblings, and we’ll use the ability of <code>:not()</code> on its own to add that condition.</p>
<pre><code>.highlight:not(:has(~ .highlight)):not(.highlight ~  *)
</code></pre>

<p>The second <code>:not()</code> condition is an <code>AND</code> clause to our selector that says “AND not itself a sibling of a previous highlight.”</p>
<p>With that, we have polyfilled the non-existent <code>:only-of-selector</code> pseudo-class!</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/has-selector-level-up-css-skills/out-of-range-styles.png" /></p>
<p>To resolve this, we need to add a complex <code>AND</code> condition using <code>:not()</code> to exclude items that are <em>not</em> between <code>[data-range="end"]</code> and <code>[data-range="start"]</code>, in that order.</p>
<p>On its own, this part of the selector reads as: “<em>do not select</em> items that follow <code>[data-range="end"]</code> which also have a later sibling of <code>[data-range="start"]</code>.”</p>
<div>
<pre><code>/* Note: this needs appended on the previous selector, not used alone */
:not([data-range="end"] ~ :has(~ [data-range="start"]))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In total, this makes for an admittedly long but very powerful selector that wasn’t possible before <code>:has()</code> without also using JavaScript due to the previous lack of the “look ahead” and “look behind” abilities in CSS.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>/* Select all between a range */
[data-range="start"] ~ :has(~ [data-range="end"]):not([data-range]):not([data-range="end"] ~ :has(~ [data-range="start"]))
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>Keep in mind that just like other selectors, you can use <code>:has()</code> when you construct a selector within JavaScript. The ability to select previous siblings, ancestors and the other features we’ve learned will also make your JS selectors more efficiently powerful!</blockquote>

Linear Range Selection Based On State
<p>Let’s pull together some of the qualities of <code>:has()</code> selectors and combinators we’ve learned to make a star rating component.</p>
<p>The underlying “star” will be a radio input, which will give us access to a <code>:checked</code> state to assist in developing the selectors.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="star-rating"&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Rate this demo&lt;/legend&gt;
    &lt;div class="stars"&gt;
      &lt;label class="star"&gt;
        &lt;input type="radio" name="rating" value="1"&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;!-- ...4 more stars --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As shown in the following video preview, when a user hovers over the outlined stars, then the range from the start (left-most) to the hovered star should fill in with color. On selection, when the star radio is checked, the star and labeling number scale up in size and keep the fill color. If the user hovers over stars after the checked star, the range should fill in the stars up to the hover. If the user hovers stars before the checked star, the range should fill in only up to the hovered star, and stars between the hover and previously checked star should have the fill color lightened.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of ranges to keep track of, but with <code>:has()</code>, we can break them into segmented selectors real quick!</p>
<p>The following selector series applies to all states where we want a star or range of stars to fill in for or up to the <code>:checked</code> star. The rule updates a set of custom properties that will affect the star shape, created through a combo of the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements on the <code>label.star</code>.</p>
<p>Altogether, this rule selects the range of stars between the first star and the star being hovered, <em>or</em> the first star and the star with a checked radio.</p>
<pre><code>.star:hover,
/* Previous siblings of hovered star */
.star:has(~ .star:hover),
/* Star has a checked radio */
.star:has(:checked),
/* Previous siblings of a checked star */
.star:has(~ .star :checked) {
  --star-rating-bg: dodgerblue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we want to lighten the fill color of stars in the range between the star being hovered and a later checked star, <em>and</em> checked stars that follow the hovered star.</p>
<pre><code>/* Siblings between a hovered star and a checked star */
.star:hover ~ .star:has(~ .star :checked),
/* Checked star following a hovered star */
.star:hover ~ .star:has(:checked) {
  --star-rating-bg: lightblue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as state selectors go for our star rating component, that’s all there is to it!</p>
<p>The CodePen demo has a few extra tricks on how the component is created using CSS grid, custom properties, and <code>clip-path</code>. For accessibility, it also ensures color isn’t the only indicator by scaling up the checked star. And it handles for <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/">high contrast themes</a> (aka “forced colors”) by supplying values from the system colors palette to ensure the <code>:checked</code> star fill is visible. Additionally, the transitions are shortened when a user prefers reduced motion.</p>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/ExpoWwv">Star Rating Component with :has() [forked]</a> by <a href="https://codepen.io/5t3ph">Stephanie Eckles</a>.</p>
Stateful Multi-Range Selection Groups
<p>Whereas the star rating component showed a dynamic style change based on state, the availability of stateful elements also makes it easier to use <code>:has()</code> for creating visual boundaries.</p>
<p>Our earlier multi-range selectors relied on manually adding “hooks” into the markup to correctly style ranges without leaking into the in-between areas. But if we have a field set containing checkboxes, we can once again use the <code>:checked</code> state to clearly identify boundaries around checked and unchecked items.</p>
<p>In this preview video, as checkboxes are selected, they receive a border and green background to create the visual boundary. Thanks to <code>:has()</code>, that boundary grows to appear to wrap groups of checked items so that the visual box seems as though it's around the whole group. The first item (or a singleton) gets round top corners, and the last item (or a singleton) gets round bottom corners as well as a slight shadow.</p>
<p>We need to create rules to handle the top, middle, and bottom appearance based on where the item falls within the set. Single items should receive all three styles.</p>
<p>Our HTML is set up to wrap each checkbox input with its label, so all of our selectors will begin by matching against <code>label:has(:checked)</code> to see if the label <em>contains</em> a checked input.</p>
<p>To determine either the first or single item in the set, we need to add the condition that it is <em>not</em> following a previous item with a checked input. This rule will style the top appearance.</p>
<pre><code>/* First checked item in a range
 OR top of a single checked item */
label:has(:checked):not(label:has(:checked) + label)
</code></pre>

<p>To determine either the last or single item in the set, we flip the previous condition to check that it is <em>not</em> followed by a checked input. This rule will style the bottom appearance.</p>
<pre><code>/* Last checked item in a range
 OR bottom of a single checked item */
label:has(:checked):not(label:has(+ label :checked))
</code></pre>

<p>For the middle appearance, we’ll create a rule that actually captures the group from start to finish since all of the items in the rule should receive a background color and side borders.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> simply use <code>label:has(:checked)</code> for this selector given the context. However, we’re learning how to select and style ranges, so to complete our exercise, we’ll write the expanded selectors.</p>
<p>The logic represented in the first selector is “select labels with checked inputs that are followed by sibling labels containing checked inputs,” which captures all but the last item in the range. For that, we repeat the selector we just created for styling the last checked item in the range.</p>
<pre><code>/* Range of checked items */
label:has(:checked):has(~ label :checked),
label:has(:checked):not(label:has(+ label :checked))
</code></pre>

<p>This CodePen demo also shows off <code>accent-color</code> for changing the checked input color and uses custom properties for managing the border radius. It also uses logical properties.</p>

And when a component doesn’t work, what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>Does the component functionally not do what it’s expected to do, like a tab system that doesn’t switch to the correct panel? Or is it too rigid to support the designed content, such as a button with an icon after the content instead of before it? Or perhaps it’s too pre-defined and structured to support a slight variant, like a modal that always had a header section, now requiring a variant without one?</p>
<p>Such is the life of a component. All too often, they’re built for a narrow objective, then hastily extended for minor one-off variations again and again until it no longer <em>works</em>. At that point, a new component is created, the technical debt grows, the onboarding learning curve becomes steeper, and the maintainability of the codebase is more challenging.</p>
<p>Is this simply the inevitable lifecycle of a component? Or can this situation be averted? And, most importantly, if it <em>can</em> be averted, how?</p>
<p>Selfishness. Or perhaps, self-interest. Better yet, maybe a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Far too often, components are far too considerate. Too considerate of one another and, especially, too considerate of their own content. In order to create components that scale with a product, the name of the game is self-interest bordering on selfishness — cold-hearted, narcissistic, the-world-revolves-around-me selfishness.</p>
<p>This article isn’t going to settle the centuries-old debate about the line between self-interest and selfishness. Frankly, I’m not qualified to take part in any philosophical debate. However, what this article <em>is</em> going to do is demonstrate that building selfish components is in the best interest of every other component, designer, developer, and person consuming your content. In fact, selfish components create so much good around them that you could almost say they’re selfless.</p>
<p>I don’t know 🤷‍♀️ Let’s look at some components and decide for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>All code examples and demos in this article will be based on React and TypeScript. However, the concepts and patterns are framework agnostic.</em></p>
The Consideration Iterations
<p>Perhaps, the best way to demonstrate a considerate component is by walking through the lifecycle of one. We’ll be able to see how they start small and functional but become unwieldy once the design evolves. Each iteration backs the component further into a corner until the design and needs of the product outgrow the capabilities of the component itself.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the modest <code>Button</code> component. It’s deceptively complex and quite often trapped in the consideration pattern, and therefore, a great example of working through.</p>
<h3>Iteration 1</h3>
<p>While these sample designs are quite barebones, like not showing various <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, and <code>disabled</code> states, they do showcase a simple button with two color themes.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/1-barebones-button-design.jpeg" /></p>
<p>At first glance, it’s possible the resulting <code>Button</code> component could be as barebones as the design.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>// First, extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React.
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"button"&gt; &amp; {
  text: string;
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<pre><code>&lt;Button
  onClick={someFunction}
  text="Add to cart"
  theme="primary"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It’s possible, and perhaps even likely, that we’ve all seen a <code>Button</code> component like this. Maybe we’ve even made one like it ourselves. Some of the namings may be different, but the props, or the API of the <code>Button</code>, are roughly the same.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of the design, the <code>Button</code> defines props for the <code>theme</code> and <code>text</code>. This first iteration works and meets the current needs of both the design and the product. </p>
<p>However, the current needs of the design and product are rarely the final needs. When the next design iterations are created, the <em>Add to cart</em> button now requires an icon.</p>
<h3>Iteration 2</h3>
<p>After validating the UI of the product, it was decided that adding an icon to the <em>Add to cart</em> button would be beneficial. The designs explain, though, that not every button will include an icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/2-button-design-iteration-new-icon-variant.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Returning to our <code>Button</code> component, its props can be extended with an optional <code>icon</code> prop which maps to the name of an icon to conditionally render.</p>
<pre><code>type ButtonProps = {
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  text: string;
  icon?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;Button
  theme="primary"
  onClick={someFunction}
  text="Add to cart"
  icon="cart"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whew! Crisis averted.</p>
<p>With the new <code>icon</code> prop, the <code>Button</code> can now support variants with or without an icon. Of course, this assumes the icon will always be shown at the end of the text, which, to the surprise of nobody, is not the case when the next iteration is designed.</p>
<h3>Iteration 3</h3>
<p>The previous <code>Button</code> component implementation included the icon at the text’s end, but the new designs require an icon to optionally be placed at the start of the text. The single <code>icon</code> prop will no longer fit the needs of the latest design requirements.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/3-updated-button-design-variants-multiple%20icon-placements.jpeg" /></p>
<p>There are a few different directions that can be taken to meet this new product requirement. Maybe an <code>iconPosition</code> prop can be added to the <code>Button</code>. But what if there comes a need to have an icon on both sides? Maybe our <code>Button</code> component can get ahead of this assumed requirement and make a few changes to the props.</p>
<p>The single <code>icon</code> prop will no longer fit the needs of the product, so it’s removed. In its place, two new props are introduced, <code>iconAtStart</code> and <code>iconAtEnd</code>.</p>
<pre><code>type ButtonProps = {
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  text: string;
  iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
}
</code></pre>

<p>After refactoring the existing uses of <code>Button</code> in the codebase to use the new props, another crisis is averted. Now, the <code>Button</code> has some flexibility. It’s all hardcoded and wrapped in conditionals within the component itself, but surely, what the UI doesn’t know can’t hurt it.</p>
<p>Up until this point, the <code>Button</code> icons have always been the same color as the text. It seems reasonable and like a reliable default, but let’s throw a wrench into this well-oiled component by defining a variation with a contrasting color icon.</p>
<h3>Iteration 4</h3>
<p>In order to provide a sense of feedback, this confirmation UI stage was designed to be shown temporarily when an item has been added to the cart successfully.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a time when the development team chooses to push back against the product requirements. But despite the push, the decision is made to move forward with providing color flexibility to <code>Button</code> icons.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/4-button-design-iteration-contrasting%20icon-color.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Again, multiple approaches can be taken for this. Maybe an <code>iconClassName</code> prop is passed into the <code>Button</code> to have greater control over the icon’s appearance. But there are other product development priorities, and instead, a quick fix is done.</p>
<p>As a result, an <code>iconColor</code> prop is added to the <code>Button</code>.</p>
<pre><code>type ButtonProps = {
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  text: string;
  iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  iconColor?: 'green' | '...other-theme-color-names';
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the quick fix in place, the <code>Button</code> icons can now be styled differently than the text. The UI can provide the designed confirmation, and the product can, once again, move forward.</p>
<p>Of course, as product requirements continue to grow and expand, so do their designs.</p>
<h3>Iteration 5</h3>
<p>With the latest designs, the <code>Button</code> must now be used with only an icon. This can be done in a few different approaches, yet again, but all of them require some amount of refactoring.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/5-design-iteration-icon-only-button.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Perhaps a new <code>IconButton</code> component is created, duplicating all other button logic and styles into two places. Or maybe that logic and styles are centralized and shared across both components. However, in this example, the development team decides to keep all the variants in the same <code>Button</code> component.</p>
<p>Instead, the <code>text</code> prop is marked as optional. This could be as quick as marking it as optional in the props but could require additional refactoring if there’s any logic expecting the <code>text</code> to exist. </p>
<p>But then comes the question, if the <code>Button</code> is to have only an icon, which icon prop should be used? Neither <code>iconAtStart</code> nor <code>iconAtEnd</code> appropriately describes the <code>Button</code>. Ultimately, it’s decided to bring the original <code>icon</code> prop back and use <em>it</em> for the icon-only variant.</p>
<pre><code>type ButtonProps = {
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  iconColor?: 'green' | '...other-theme-color-names';
  icon?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
  text?: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>Button</code> API is getting confusing. Maybe a few comments are left in the component to explain when and when not to use specific props, but the learning curve is growing steeper, and the potential for error is increasing.</p>
<p>For example, without adding great complexity to the <code>ButtonProps</code> type, there is no stopping a person from using the <code>icon</code> and <code>text</code> props at the same time. This could either break the UI or be resolved with greater conditional complexity within the <code>Button</code> component itself. Additionally, the <code>icon</code> prop can be used with either or both of the <code>iconAtStart</code> and <code>IconAtEnd</code> props as well. Again, this could either break the UI or be resolved with even more layers of conditionals within the component.</p>
<p>Our beloved <code>Button</code> has become quite unmanageable at this point. Hopefully, the product has reached a point of stability where no new changes or requirements will ever happen again. Ever.</p>
<h3>Iteration 6</h3>
<p>So much for never having any more changes. 🤦</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/6-final-button-iteration-formatted-content.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This next and final iteration of the <code>Button</code> is the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back. In the <em>Add to cart</em> button, if the current item is already in the cart, we want to show the quantity of which on the button. On the surface, this is a straightforward change of dynamically building the <code>text</code> prop string. But the component breaks down because the current item count requires a different font weight and an underline. Because the <code>Button</code> accepts only a plain text string and no other child elements, the component no longer <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>Would this design have broken the <code>Button</code> if this was the second iteration? Maybe not. The component and codebase were both much younger then. But the codebase has grown so much by this point that refactoring for this requirement is a mountain to climb.</p>
<p>This is when one of the following things will likely happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a much larger refactor to move the <code>Button</code> away from a <code>text</code> prop to accepting <code>children</code> or accepting a component or markup as the <code>text</code> value.</li>
<li>The <code>Button</code> is split into a separate <code>AddToCart</code> button with an even more rigid API specific to this one use case. This also either duplicates any button logic and styles into multiple places or extracts them into a centralized file to share everywhere.</li>
<li>The <code>Button</code> is deprecated, and a <code>ButtonNew</code> component is created, splitting the codebase, introducing technical debt, and increasing the onboarding learning curve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither outcome is ideal.</p>
<p>So, where did the <code>Button</code> component go wrong?</p>
Sharing Is Impairing
<p>What is the responsibility of an HTML <code>button</code> element exactly? Narrowing down this answer will shine light onto the issues facing the previous <code>Button</code> component.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the native HTML <code>button</code> element go no further than:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display, without opinion, whatever content is passed into it.</li>
<li>Handle native functionality and attributes such as <code>onClick</code> and <code>disabled</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, each browser has its own version of how a <code>button</code> element may look and display content, but CSS resets are often used to strip those opinions away. As a result, the <code>button</code> element boils down to little more than a functional container for triggering events.</p>
<p>The onus of formatting any content within the <code>button</code> isn’t the responsibility of the <code>button</code> but of the content itself. The <code>button</code> shouldn’t care. The <code>button</code> should not share the responsibility for its content. </p>
<blockquote>The core issue with the considerate component design is that component props define the content and not the component itself.</blockquote>

<p>In the previous <code>Button</code> component, the first major limitation was the <code>text</code> prop. From the first iteration, a limitation was placed on the content of the <code>Button</code>. While the <code>text</code> prop fit with the designs at that stage, it immediately deviated from the two core responsibilities of the native HTML <code>button</code>. It immediately forced the <code>Button</code> to be aware of and responsible for its content.</p>
<p>In the following iterations, the icon was introduced. While it seemed reasonable to bake a conditional icon into the <code>Button</code>, also doing so deviated from the core <code>button</code> responsibilities. Doing so limited the use cases of the component. In later iterations, the icon needed to be available in different positions, and the <code>Button</code> props were forced to expand to style the icon.</p>
<p>When the component is responsible for the content it displays, it needs an API that can accommodate all content variations. Eventually, that API will break down because the content will forever and always change.</p>
Introducing The Me In Team
<p>There’s an adage used in all team sports, “There’s no ‘I’ in a team.” While this mindset is noble, some of the greatest individual athletes have embodied other ideas.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan famously responded with his own perspective, <em>“There’s an ‘I’ in win.”</em> The late Kobe Bryant had a similar idea, <em>“There’s an ‘M-E’ in [team].”</em></p>
<p>Our original <code>Button</code> component was a team player. It shared the responsibility of its content until it reached the point of deprecation. How could the <code>Button</code> have avoided such constraints by embodying a <em>“M-E in team”</em> attitude?</p>
Me, Myself, And UI
<blockquote>When the component is responsible for the content it displays, it will break down because the content will forever and always change.</blockquote>

<p>How would a selfish component design approach have changed our original <code>Button</code>?</p>
<p>Keeping the two core responsibilities of the HTML <code>button</code> element in mind, the structure of our <code>Button</code> component would have immediately been different.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>// First, extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React.
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"button"&gt; &amp; {
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<pre><code>&lt;Button
  onClick={someFunction}
  theme="primary"
&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Add to cart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By removing the original <code>text</code> prop in lieu of limitless <code>children</code>, the <code>Button</code> is able to align with its core responsibilities. The <code>Button</code> can now act as little more than a container for triggering events.</p>
<p>By moving the <code>Button</code> to its native approach of supporting child content, the various icon-related props are no longer required. An icon can now be rendered anywhere within the <code>Button</code> regardless of size and color. Perhaps the various icon-related props could be extracted into their own selfish <code>Icon</code> component.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Button
  onClick={someFunction}
  theme="primary"
&gt;
  &lt;Icon name="cart" /&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Add to cart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With the content-specific props removed from the <code>Button</code>, it can now do what all selfish characters do best, think about itself.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>// First, extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React.
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"button"&gt; &amp; {
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  variant: 'ghost' | 'solid' | 'outline' | 'link'
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>With an API specific to itself and independent content, the <code>Button</code> is now a maintainable component. The self-interest props keep the learning curve minimal and intuitive while retaining great flexibility for various <code>Button</code> use cases.</p>
<p><code>Button</code> icons can now be placed at either end of the content.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Button
  onClick={someFunction}
  size="md"
  theme="primary"
  variant="solid"
&gt;
  &lt;Box display="flex" gap="2" alignItems="center"&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Add to cart&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;Icon name="cart" /&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or, a <code>Button</code> could have only an icon.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Button
  onClick={someFunction}
  size="sm"
  theme="secondary"
  variant="solid"
&gt;
  &lt;Icon name="cart" /&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, a product may evolve over time, and selfish component design improves the ability to evolve along with it. Let’s go beyond the <code>Button</code> and into the cornerstones of selfish component design.</p>
The Keys to Selfish Design
<p>Much like when creating a fictional character, it’s best to show, not tell, the reader that they’re selfish. By reading about the character’s thoughts and actions, their personality and traits can be understood. Component design can take the same approach.</p>
<p>But how exactly do we show in a component’s design and use that it is selfish?</p>
<h3>HTML Drives The Component Design</h3>
<p>Many times, components are built as direct abstractions of native HTML elements like a <code>button</code> or <code>img</code>. When this is the case, let the native HTML element drive the design of the component. </p>
<p>Specifically, if the native HTML element accepts children, the abstracted component should as well. Every aspect of a component that deviates from its native element is something that must be learned anew.</p>
<p>When our original <code>Button</code> component deviated from the native behavior of the <code>button</code> element by not supporting child content, it not only became rigid but it required a mental model shift just to use the component.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of time and thought put into the structure and definitions of HTML elements. The wheel doesn’t need to be reinvented every time.</p>
<h3>Children Fend For Themselves</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever read <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, you know just how dangerous it can be when a group of children is forced to fend for themselves. However, in the case of selfish component design, we’ll be doing exactly that.</p>
<p>As shown in our original <code>Button</code> component, the more it tried to style its content, the more rigid and complicated it became. When we removed that responsibility, the component was able to do a lot more but with a lot less.</p>
<p>Many elements are little more than semantic containers. It’s not often we expect a <code>section</code> element to style its content. A <code>button</code> element is just a very specific type of semantic container. The same approach can apply when abstracting it to a component.</p>
<h3>Components Are Singularly Focused</h3>
<p>Think of selfish component design as arranging a bunch of terrible first dates. A component’s props are like the conversation that is entirely focused on them and their immediate responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do I look?</strong><br />Props need to feed the ego of the component. In our refactored <code>Button</code> example, we did this with props like <code>size</code>, <code>theme</code>, and <code>variant</code>.</li>
<li><strong>What am I doing?</strong><br />A component should only be interested in what it, and it alone, is doing. Again, in our refactored <code>Button</code> component, we do this with the <code>onClick</code> prop. As far as the <code>Button</code> is concerned, if there’s another click event somewhere within its content, that’s the content’s problem. The <code>Button</code> does. not. care.</li>
<li><strong>When and where am I going next?</strong><br />Any jet-setting traveler is quick to talk about their next destination. For components like modals, drawers, and tooltips, when and where they’re going is just as gravely important. Components like these are not always rendered in the DOM. This means that in addition to knowing how they look and what they do, they need to know when and where to be. In other words, this can be described with props like <code>isShown</code> and <code>position</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composition Is King</h3>
<p>Some components, such as modals and drawers, can often contain different layout variations. For example, some modals will show a header bar while others do not. Some drawers may have a footer with a call to action. Others may have no footer at all.</p>
<p>Instead of defining each layout in a single <code>Modal</code> or <code>Drawer</code> component with conditional props like <code>hasHeader</code> or <code>showFooter</code>, break the single component into multiple composable child components.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.CloseButton /&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Header&gt; ... &lt;/Modal.Header&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Main&gt; ... &lt;Modal.Main&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;Drawer&gt;
  &lt;Drawer.Main&gt; ... &lt;/Drawer.Main&gt;
  &lt;Drawer.Footer&gt; ... &lt;/Drawer.Footer&gt;
&lt;/Drawer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By using component composition, each individual component can be as selfish as it wants to be and used only when and where it’s needed. This keeps the root component’s API clean and can move many props to their specific child component.</p>
<p>Let’s explore this and the other keys to selfish component design a bit more.</p>
You’re So Vain, You Probably Think This Code Is About You
<p>Perhaps the keys of selfish design make sense when looking back at the evolution of our <code>Button</code> component. Nevertheless, let’s apply them again to another commonly problematic component — the modal.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/7-edit-profile-modal.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/8-upload-successful-modal-iteration.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-good-component-design-selfishness/9-friends-modal-iteration.png" /></p>
<p>For this example, we have the benefit of foresight in the three different modal layouts. This will help steer the direction of our <code>Modal</code> while applying each key of selfish design along the way.</p>
<p>First, let’s go over our mental model and break down the layouts of each design.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Edit Profile</strong> modal, there are defined header, main and footer sections. There’s also a close button. In the <strong>Upload Successful</strong> modal, there’s a modified header with no close button and a hero-like image. The buttons in the footer are also stretched. Lastly, in the <strong>Friends</strong> modal, the close button returns, but now the content area is scrollable, and there’s no footer.</p>
<p>So, what did we learn?</p>
<p>We learned that the header, main and footer sections are interchangeable. They may or may not exist in any given view. We also learned that the close button functions independently and is not tied to any specific layout or section.</p>
<p>Because our <code>Modal</code> can be comprised of interchangeable layouts and arrangements, that’s our sign to take a composable child component approach. This will allow us to plug and play pieces into the <code>Modal</code> as needed.</p>
<p>This approach allows us to very narrowly define the responsibilities of our root <code>Modal</code> component.</p>
<p><strong>Conditionally render with any combination of content layouts.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it. So long as our <code>Modal</code> is just a conditionally-rendered container, it will never need to care about or be responsible for its content.</p>
<p>With the core responsibility of our <code>Modal</code> defined, and the composable child component approach decided, let’s break down each composable piece and its role.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Role</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;Modal&gt;</code></td>
            <td>This is the entry point of the entire <code>Modal</code> component. This container is responsible for when and where to render, how the modal looks, and what it does, like handle accessibility considerations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;Modal.CloseButton /&gt;</code></td>
            <td>An interchangeable <code>Modal</code> child component that can be included only when needed. This component will work similarly to our refactored <code>Button</code> component. It will be responsible for how it looks, where it’s shown, and what it does.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;Modal.Header&gt;</code></td>
            <td>The header section will be an abstraction of the native HTML <code>header</code> element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content, like headings or images, to be shown.</td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;Modal.Main&gt;</code></td>
            <td>The main section will be an abstraction of the native HTML <code>main</code> element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content. </td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;Modal.Footer&gt;</code></td>
            <td>The footer section will be an abstraction of the native HTML <code>footer</code> element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content. </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>With each component and its role defined, we can start creating props to support those roles and responsibilities.</p>
<h4><code>Modal</code></h4>
<p>Earlier, we defined the barebones responsibility of the <code>Modal</code>, knowing when to conditionally render. This can be achieved using a prop like <code>isShown</code>. Therefore, we can use these props, and whenever it’s <code>true</code>, the <code>Modal</code> and its content will render.</p>
<pre><code>type ModalProps = {
  isShown: boolean;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;Modal isShown={showModal}&gt;
  ...
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any styling and positioning can be done with CSS in the <code>Modal</code> component directly. There’s no need to create specific props at this time.</p>
<h4><code>Modal.CloseButton</code></h4>
<p>Given our previously refactored <code>Button</code> component, we know how the <code>CloseButton</code> should work. Heck, we can even use our <code>Button</code> to build our <code>CloseButton</code> component.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>import { Button, ButtonProps } from 'components/Button';

export function CloseButton({ onClick, ...props }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    &lt;Button {...props} onClick={onClick} variant="ghost" theme="primary" /&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} /&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4><code>Modal.Header</code>, <code>Modal.Main</code>, <code>Modal.Footer</code></h4>
<p>Each of the individual layout sections, <code>Modal.Header</code>, <code>Modal.Main</code>, and <code>Modal.Footer</code>, can take direction from their HTML equivalents, <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, and <code>footer</code>. Each of these elements supports any variation of child content, and therefore, our components will do the same.</p>
<p>There are no special props needed. They serve only as semantic containers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} /&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Header&gt; ... &lt;/Modal.Header&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Main&gt; ... &lt;/Modal.Main&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Footer&gt; ... &lt;/Modal.Footer&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With our <code>Modal</code> component and its child component defined, let’s see how they can be used interchangeably to create each of the three designs.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The full markup and styles are not shown so as not to take away from the core takeaways.</em></p>
<h3>Edit Profile Modal</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Edit Profile</strong> modal, we use each of the <code>Modal</code> components. However, each is used only as a container that styles and positions itself. This is why we haven’t included a <code>className</code> prop for them. Any content styling should be handled by the content itself, not our container components.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} /&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Header&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Main&gt;
    &lt;div className="modal-avatar-selection-wrapper"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;form className="modal-profile-form"&gt; ... &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Main&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Footer&gt;
    &lt;div className="modal-button-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;Button onClick={closeModal} theme="tertiary"&gt;Cancel&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button onClick={saveProfile} theme="secondary"&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Footer&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Upload Successful Modal</h3>
<p>Like in the previous example, the <strong>Upload Successful</strong> modal uses its components as opinionless containers. The styling for the content is handled by the content itself. Perhaps this means the buttons could be stretched by the <code>modal-button-wrapper</code> class, or we could add a <em>“how do I look?”</em> prop, like <code>isFullWidth</code>, to the <code>Button</code> component for a wider or full-width size.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.Header&gt;
    &lt;img src="..." alt="..." /&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Upload Successful&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Header&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div className="modal-copy-upload-link-wrapper"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Main&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Footer&gt;
    &lt;div className="modal-button-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;Button onClick={closeModal} theme="tertiary"&gt;Skip&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button onClick={saveProfile} theme="secondary"&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Footer&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Friends Modal</h3>
<p>Lastly, our <strong>Friends</strong> modal does away with the <code>Modal.Footer</code> section. Here, it may be enticing to define the overflow styles on <code>Modal.Main</code>, but that is extending the container’s responsibilities to its content. Instead, handling those styles is better suited in the <code>modal-friends-wrapper</code> class.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Modal&gt;
  &lt;Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} /&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;AngusMcSix's Friends&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Header&gt;

  &lt;Modal.Main&gt;
      &lt;div className="modal-friends-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Modal.Main&gt;
&lt;/Modal&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With a selfishly designed <code>Modal</code> component, we can accommodate evolving and changing designs with flexible and tightly scoped components.</p>
<h3>Next Modal Evolutions</h3>
<p>Given all that we’ve covered, let’s throw around some hypotheticals regarding our <code>Modal</code> and how it may evolve. How would <em>you</em> approach these design variations?</p>
<p>A design requires a fullscreen modal. How would you adjust the <code>Modal</code> to accommodate a fullscreen variation?</p>
<p>Another design is for a 2-step registration process. How could the <code>Modal</code> accommodate this type of design and functionality?</p>

Recap
<p>Components are the workhorses of modern web development. Greater importance continues to be placed on component libraries, either standalone or as part of a design system. With how fast the web moves, having components that are accessible, stable, and resilient is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, components are often built to do too much. They are built to inherit the responsibilities and concerns of their content and surroundings. So many patterns that apply this level of consideration break down further each iteration until a component no longer <em>works</em>. At this point, the codebase splits, more technical debt is introduced, and inconsistencies creep into the UI.</p>
<p>If we break a component down to its core responsibilities and build an API of props that only define those responsibilities, without consideration of content inside or around the component, we build components that can be resilient to change. This selfish approach to component design ensures a <strong>component is only responsible for itself and not its content</strong>. Treating components as little more than semantic containers means content can change or even move between containers without effect. The less considerate a component is about its content and its surroundings, the better for everybody — better for the content that will forever change, better for the consistency of the design and UI, which in turn is better for the people consuming that changing content, and lastly, better for the developers using the components.</p>
<p>The key to the good component design is selfishness. Being a considerate team player is the responsibility of the developer.</p>

Meeting people, talking, and generally being an outspoken person will be noticeable. However, we all tend to reflect on our inner worlds when we need to disconnect and be with ourselves. It helps us refocus or be safe from external factors affecting our tranquility. Introverts linger more than often in that internal world. Famous personalities such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Steven Spielberg, to mention a few, are successful introverts. They are excellent at what they do because of a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They are keen observers.</strong><br />For introverts, the spotlight is not important. Anyone but them can run the show.</li>
<li><strong>Introverts think carefully before speaking.</strong><br />In a discussion, they would participate but would not speak up unless it was necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Potential leaders.</strong><br />Introverts let others run with their ideas and contribute only when needed. It is a great trait since it allows others to be more creative than directive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two relevant sources discuss introversion. First, the book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylCd1XBPgXd60-fs2FAWp2HWmnZ31TGYVXnSDMrBVdd1VRIsZDLihdhoCX04QAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=241585250355&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9007322&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=10520191965285425879&amp;hvtargid=kwd-26256244941&amp;hydadcr=15529_10341050&amp;keywords=quiet+the+power+of+introverts&amp;qid=1672790280&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Quiet</em></a> by Susan Cain, American author and lecturer, where she discusses what the extrovert ideal is: “the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight.” In contrast, she discusses introversion as an undervalued asset in today’s society, being often confused with shyness. However, confidence and competence happen with experience and expertise, and introverts possess them. </p>
<p>The second source comes from a study called the “<a href="https://hanseysenck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1967_eysenck_eysenck_-_salivary_response_to_lemon_juice_as_measure_of.pdf">Lemon Juice Experiment</a>” conducted by H.J. Eysenck, Professor of Psychology at King’s College in London, along with Sybil B.G. Eysenck. The researchers observed that introverts salivate more compared to extroverts when a drop of lemon juice is placed on their tongues. They theorized that introverts get triggered by their surroundings since they have naturally higher arousal levels. Because of this, they prefer less socially intensive activities such as reading, writing, or biking, usually by themselves. Their inward-orientedness makes them unique.</p>
<p>The quiet traits of an introverted personality inspired me with the idea of Introverted Design. This design style would create an excellent balance to the existing experiences that scream for attention. A known example of these experiences is Instagram. Instagram used to be a simple photo and video-sharing app that everyone easily got hooked on. However, now it has grown with a multitude of features such as a marketplace, reels, a highly sophisticated editor, filters, and so on. If we look back to the start of Instagram and where it is now, it is a much busier and more complicated experience than it used to be. </p>
<p>Similar to how Instagram has positioned itself, most designs tend to be bold. However, there are also plenty of very subtle products where the experience itself does all the heavy lifting impeccably. Spotify is a good example. <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> offers a plethora of music based on the choices the user has already made in their playlists. Basically, there is less scope creep while directly centered around listening. They have kept their focus on music sharing over creation, for example. Due to this, its recommendation engine is hyper-focused on music, unlike Instagram, which is trying to do many things at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/1-spotify-mobile-version.png" /></p>
<p>But you may ask, what is <strong>Introverted Design</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>It is a design process inspired by introverted traits that will aid designers in building highly functional and minimalistic products.</strong> Imagine if the behavior of introversion is married to the existing design process.</p>
<ul>
<li>What will happen if the research is equipped with insightful information on top of the conventional way of “ask and answered”? </li>
<li>Will learning how introverts think help in ideating or brainstorming?</li>
<li>Introverts evaluate situations before speaking. Can this be translated to identify various risks and edge cases before designing? </li>
<li>We will look into additional traits that can be translated to incentivize the existing design process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure we all have experienced “a mental block” at some point in time when it becomes challenging to develop new ideas. Usually, it happens because we are short on research. Inculcating a new way of thinking and a new way of solving problems would aid us at various points of the design thinking and execution process. It will hopefully create a habit of grasping more information and better evaluation that would otherwise go unnoticed or overlooked and directly help to remove that mental block.</p>
<p>Now that we know a bit more about quiet traits, let’s look into some ways to incorporate these traits to create an introverted design.</p>
Identify The Nuances Of User Behavior: Subtle Discomforts
<p>A study done by Kirby M. Jaeger, Austin H. Cox, David Philip Arthur Craig, and James W. Grice, called “<a href="https://scholar.utc.edu/mps/vol21/iss1/10/">An auditory startle response predicts introversion</a>”, at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga showed that <strong>introverts tend to be more sensitive to incoming stimuli on a physiological level</strong>. The human brain has an innate ability to block unnecessary information to prevent cognitive overload is called sensory gating or sensory-motor gating. It makes introverts good observers, and they tend to notice details that would otherwise go unnoticed. Also, it occurs naturally to them. </p>
<p>Though the study remarks observation as quality introverts possess, it is not unique to them. Everyone can achieve it by training their mind to observe intently. This trait can be applied in user research to identify information that is not necessarily shared verbally, like body language, nuances in pitch, dialog delivery, eye contact, and so on. </p>
<p>For example, a few years back, I conducted a user study while working at Teltech Systems. The study was to gain insights from the users to develop an app’s spam call-blocking feature. One participant, in particular, articulated their thoughts very well. They mentioned the spam call-blocking feature was helpful and had been very beneficial in blocking most spam calls. Although the participant answered, I could sense discomfort in their voice, and they had no eye contact with me. These nuances would have gone unnoticed had I not been paying attention. My unease with the participant’s responses urged me to probe them further. As a result, I realized that the spam-blocking feature was incomplete. The probing revealed that the user would have to open the app to report any number as spam.</p>
<p>At the end of the interviews, one of the significant findings was that the end-users would appreciate it if the spam blocking feature would allow them to report and block spam calls on the call screen itself instead of reporting it through the app. After I shared this finding with the team, there was an immediate agreement, and a feature enhancement was soon released. </p>
<p>According to the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Communication-Basic-Course-14th/dp/0134407083"><em>Human Communication: The Basic Course</em></a>, Joseph DeVito, <strong>listening has five stages: receiving, understanding, remembering, evaluating, and responding</strong>. Listening carefully helps us identify those hidden messages that are commonly overlooked since listening is restricted to just what falls on the ears. Training ourselves to observe body language, the pitch of sound, metaphors, and so on could help identify the nuances in human behavior that might point to the real truth in the conversation. As designers, we could create a habit of detecting these subtle changes and ask follow-up questions to validate our observations.</p>
<p>Once the validation is complete, the next step is to strategize ideas and actions based on the research.</p>
Overthinking An Action
<p>Overthinking is often considered to be a negative trait because it means thinking too much and for too long, for example, second-guessing and constantly analyzing the decision that is already made. Is overthinking always a negative behavior? Probably not. </p>
<p>In a positive state of mind, overthinking can be taking a step back to reconsider something and looking at it as a tool to devise better strategies. For instance, doing more research before writing an article or planning the specifics of a trip can result in much better experiences. It gives us time to evaluate situations better by looking into the details. Another advantage is being able to generate multiple solutions to consider different angles, which provides a wider perspective and it helps to validate or negate assumptions as well as devise backup plans.</p>
<p>According to Jenn Granneman, an educator and journalist, as well as the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Lives-Introverts-Inside-Hidden/dp/1510721029/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DX3MF4CHH863&amp;keywords=The+Secret+Lives+of+Introverts&amp;qid=1672790807&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+secret+lives+of+introverts%2Cstripbooks%2C81&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The Secret Lives of Introverts</em></a>, “overthinking doesn’t necessarily need to be wrong.” She mentions a research study carried out by Dr. Laurie Helgoe, an American psychologist. In it, Dr. Helgoe mapped the electrical activity in participants’ brains and found that <strong>introverts have higher levels of electrical activity</strong>, thus, greater cortical arousal. It does not matter what emotional state they are in, as they <strong>tend to think more</strong>. In other words, introverts process more information making them prone to overthinking.</p>
<p>I, myself, being prone to overthinking, created a thought process that mirrors critical thinking. Identify the problem, analyze it by being open-minded, and solve the problems by creative and critical thinking — using various tools such as mind mapping, checklist, lateral thinking, and so on. By breaking overthinking into a much more digestible thinking process, I can evaluate the problems and situations better. </p>
<p>I can translate those same three steps for research as well. Usually, after conducting my first interview for any research, I listen to it to identify if I need to re-evaluate my strategy, identify any mistakes I made and tidy up the script. These are some of the questions I ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is hesitation, what made them hesitate while answering?</li>
<li>Did I make them uncomfortable?</li>
<li>If I made them a bit uncomfortable, would they share more?</li>
<li>How can I probe them further to get better answers or more in-depth answers?</li>
<li>Can I ask this question in a different way? How would they react?</li>
</ul>
<p>This overthinking process provides me with insights to evaluate a better strategy for the remaining interviews.</p>
<p>Overthinking also allows you to <strong>foresee particular possibilities</strong>. A friend was working on promotional content for their upcoming mobile app update. The business requirement was to push this quickly since the holiday season was around the corner. After an extensive session and design thinking, he came up with plenty of ideas and presented those to the stakeholders. In that working session, he identified the various cases to name a few: </p>
<ul>
<li>The changes required for implementation. </li>
<li>Will these changes affect any future work?</li>
<li>Will this change bring in more updates after the promotion ends?</li>
<li>Does it support all the other feature changes?</li>
<li>Are there any possibilities for reverting to the older version? </li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of the ideas?</li>
<li>Identify any outstanding questions or follow-up questions.</li>
<li>Can a design define the promotion and also pave the path for future enhancements?</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the business stakeholders had already agreed upon a direction. After presenting possible options to the stakeholders, my friend was able to convince and steer the focus toward one of the options because he had thought it through and had all the answers the stakeholders would ask and even more with what the direction would bring for the future of the app. Overthinking is prone to take a quick negative turn. So it is important to keep two things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify where to stop.</li>
<li>Identify if you have developed any patterns and prevent them from happening.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overthinking, if done positively, allows us to <strong>ideate more than expected</strong> and gives a clear direction with multiple points to discuss or defend a direction.</p>
<p>Overthinking could help achieve or see more possibilities sooner. It can be a strategy applied to look for additional insights while clustering ideas together in a brainstorming session.</p>
Identify Risks
<p>A risk is choosing a path, knowing that it is uncertain. In contrast, introverts take calculated risks because their overthinking has already led them through multiple outcomes, the pros and cons, allowing them to choose the one with the slightest possibility of failure.</p>
<p>A risky decision should also entail meticulous thinking about the risk itself. Since introverts tend not to need instant gratification, they take their time to evaluate. They prefer to have control over the decisions. It means they pick an option they are comfortable and confident pursuing. It does not mean they choose a safe and easy option. On the contrary, their thinking has led them to choose a path with a higher probability of success.</p>
<p>For example, a brainstorming session about implementing a product and a risk evaluation session would help identify some of the difficulties the user flow might run into. Once identified, it would be easier to find a way to fix it. A well-thought user flow, with all the use cases considered, would help us share with the rest of the team. Identifying risk and overthinking go well together. <strong>Overthinking allows us to look for possibilities, and risk analysis helps us evaluate and find the best path forward.</strong> In addition, all the edge cases, error states, and deadends can be identified in advance.</p>
Make It Objective By Practicing Active Listening
<p>Ironically, making objective decisions is a very subjective process. Crazy, right? But think about it, we all have unconscious biases. Unconscious biases are the judgments and assessments we carry outside our conscious awareness. For example, imagine we are just looking at a person; our brain builds a persona about their personality. But, in actuality, it could be very different. Introverts are no exception to the bias; they succumb to it as well. However, they have an edge, a trait that can be used to reduce this bias: <strong>active listening</strong>.</p>
<p>Multiple research papers have been published about introverts being active listeners. One such thesis paper, written by Amari-Mall and Nakhaie, both lecturers of English at Islamic Azad University, <a href="http://seas3.elte.hu/overseas/overseas21kondorosi.pdf">compared the performance of participants of English as a foreign language</a> and noticed that introverts are better listeners. In a nutshell, introverts tend to be less reactive in a conversation; they listen intently and speak only when they are confident or know enough to share. </p>
<p>Active listening was coined by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson. According to them, active listening has six stages, such as paying attention, withholding judgment, reflecting, clarity, summarizing, and sharing. Unconscious bias usually occurs just after receiving the information and making a snap judgment without reflection. We start to connect the dots based on experiences, social acceptance, inherited knowledge, and so on to develop a belief or an assertion that could be construed as biased. So, being objective becomes difficult.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/2-active-listening-stages.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was working with my product owner on enabling a paperless experience for one of our products. It took a lot of work to execute this experience due to the complexity involved in the types of documents available for paperless; the rest were mailed. It was a time-sensitive update that had to go out in the larger scheme. However, I dug deeper to understand the expectation for the design. I spent quite some time designing the solution. Eventually, my product owner was unhappy and frustrated when I presented the options to the team. I failed as a designer to pay attention, the first step in active listening, causing a chain reaction in loss of time, that too in a time-sensitive design fix. If I had paid attention and listened to the expectation without bias, the result would have been different.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/state-of-service-2019-customer-first">Hubspot Customer Service Survey 2019</a>, almost 42% of companies do not listen to their customers. The balance is tipped toward business requirements, and customer expectations are funneled out. As a result, <strong>the final designs are heavily influenced by the bias of what the team feels the customer wants, but none of it gets validated</strong>. Unconscious bias has a higher probability of being introduced, not just by the designer but by the team as well. As a result, it becomes even more pressing for the designer to be vigilant about what is being designed.</p>
<p>It is critical to make decisions towards any design implementation unbiased or, at the very least, make an honest attempt. A business that is partially fulfilling customer expectations will fail. Another responsibility that designers have is to make sure the design is validated by customers. An informed design would serve not just the business requirements, but it would also help the users. </p>
Make It Invisible
<p>So far, we have seen a few introverted traits focused on research and design thinking. The next step is more practical; <strong>making it invisible means making the experience so attuned to users’ expectations that it is perceived easily</strong>. By not introducing a shed of cognitive load, it will make the experience of the product simple. Even if the product is complicated, the experience should be easily maneuverable so that users can go from point A to B without any hassle.  </p>
<p>Introverts prefer social engagements but tend to limit them to a certain extent. They need some alone time to recharge. Even after being selectively social, they get mentally drained. To help themselves recover, they enjoy their own company. Likewise, humans are always highly stimulated, for instance, reading a book, watching TV, cooking, thinking about what to do next, and so much more. In all this chaos, we, as designers, have a moral obligation to make the experiences of all the products highly intuitive by not introducing additional cognitive load. Make it invisible. </p>
<p>Many Indie game development companies do not have the budget to market or advertise their games; they hardly get an opportunity to show them to the world. Yet some of the most popular games on the market are made by small studios or even individuals.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/3-flappy-birds-mobile.png" /></p>
<p>One such example is Flappy Birds. <a href="https://flappybird.io">Flappy Birds</a> is a game where the player has to simply tap to make the bird fly. The objective is to avoid obstacles in this infinite scroll game (technically, it is not, however, it is very difficult to beat it by reaching 9,999 points). It became an overnight sensation. The artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, who created this game, took it down because he never imagined it would become this popular and addictive. The game had very simple graphics and deceptively simple interaction, yet it became one of the most downloaded games on Appstore and Google Play. Similarly, a design for any app could also be as simple as Flappy Bird to fulfill user expectations.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/4-citi-bike-map-scan.png" /></p>
<blockquote>“Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it.”<br /><br />— <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool">Jared Spool</a>, an expert in the field of design and research</blockquote>

<p>In other words, “making it invisible” means creating an experience that does not make the user think. It is <strong>so intuitive that it feels natural</strong>. Imagine someone reading your mind and giving you precisely what you want at the exact time.</p>
<p>Another great example is the app <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/how-it-works/app">Citi Bike</a>, which is mostly used by New Yorkers and tourists alike to commute or explore. It allows the user to easily book a bike for the next 30 mins by undocking it from their generously placed docks throughout the city. If you look at the app, nothing seems to be missing, and everything is easy and intuitive, but it can be invisible. </p>
<p>The moment the app opens, the user sees their location and a button to scan the QR code. Once they scan the code on the bike, it is unlocked. They can then enjoy their ride for the next 30 mins. This is all great, but can the experience be made invisible? Can it be made even better? Of course, it can. Imagine the app would detect the proximity of the user and show the scan code screen directly when they are near a dock. The experience is far more attuned to users’ needs. Just making this small adjustment to the flow would reduce the additional action and make the product, well, invisible.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/5-jetblue-home-experience.png" /></p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.jetblue.com/mobile-app">Jetblue’s</a> mobile app shows points and additional featured content to make up the homepage. However, the main goal is to either view their booking or make a reservation. The user then has to navigate to the book section to make any reservation. This process could be enhanced by simply introducing a search bar that is less intrusive on the homepage.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/6-jetblue-home-experience.png" /></p>
<p>A design does not need to use bright colors, flash call to action (CTA), or jargon words to make it sound smart. It could be very simple but effective with colors, transitions, easy-to-track CTAs, and simple sentences so that anyone can understand it.</p>
<p>Any design decisions we make as designers should help the user quickly complete the task they had in mind when they opened the app. <strong>Empathy articulation</strong> is a way of understanding the user’s expectations, foreseeing user interaction issues, and translating them into an effortless, actionable, invisible, and affordable design by being mindful. The more we practice invisible design, the better user experiences we can create.</p>
Help The User When Needed
<p>Introverts have a hard time asking for help even if they need it. When others ask them to reach out if they need help, chances are introverts will not reach out. The inherent need to ask for help gets buried because reaching out is difficult for them. Some form of proactivity is needed from others to get them to speak. Of course, this does not mean they are shy. That also does not mean they will never reach out, shifting all the effort onto others. Introverts would find ways to solve the problem by themselves, but they would reach out if nothing worked. However, they would certainly appreciate a nudge. </p>
<p>Help can be needed at any given time, and it should be available. If the idea of “checking with someone” is used in digital media, it will help users to get the needed help when they need it the most. It will give them comfort and improve the experience in general. Imagine a user is trying to find something, and the product identifies their struggle. It would be helpful to push a chatbot or a popover to ask if they need any help. Use the space to assist them. What if there could be an easy way to identify a problem and provide a few options to resolve the issue? What if the control system could help them in their moment of need by recommending a choice? </p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/7-canyon-bikes-website.png" /></p>
<p>Here is a good example: you visit the <a href="https://www.canyon.com/en-us/">Canyon bikes</a> website looking for a brand-new bike for your next adventure, but you have a hard time differentiating between them. All the scrambling and looking for the right model puts you in a paradox of choice. Which bike to pick? However, the website has solved it quite elegantly. After a while, the chat bubble automatically opens up, asking if you want to chat. This feature puts you in line to talk to a representative who can help you locate the exact bike that will satisfy your needs. Here if you notice, the website realized you could not find the bike and surged up to help. It was at the right time and was not invasive, keeping you, as the customer, rooted in the experience.</p>
<p>The help should also be <strong>accurate and precise</strong>, with actionable items or connecting you to a live agent like in the above example. Otherwise, as much as help is needed, it might pile on more confusion than reduce it. That brings us to the next and final trait.</p>
Subtlety
<p>Introverts enjoy speaking directly yet deftly. They think talking elaborately would stretch the conversation further and make it exponentially longer than they would prefer and also stir up confusion. Introverts believe that a minimal set of words can make a high impact. Similarly, being subtle can bolster a user experience even further. The user experience can be precise to what the user wants instead of creating a visually complicated path. <a href="https://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>, for instance, has no visual design elements compared to many products out there, but it still fulfills customer expectations because the website has a good UX. The arrangement and categorization are well thought out, making the entire experience far smoother.</p>
<p>The implementation of the language is also a part of the user experience, and it should be simple and easy to comprehend. Complex and complicated language tends to alienate users and cause them to overlook important information. </p>
<p>Likewise, keeping a design minimalistic will make the entire experience better, including the language. <strong>Subtlety is about keeping the experience to the bare minimum; it should not be overdramatic.</strong> Burdening users with too much information or too many interactions puts them in a paradox of choice. </p>
<p>User experience is about building pleasure around expectation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shazam.com/home">Shazam</a> is a compelling app that identifies the tune to help you learn more about the song you liked but do not know the name of. They have made using the tool even simpler by integrating it with Siri. “Hey, Siri, which song is this?” will bring up Shazam to help identify the song. Now that is subtlety.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-for-introverts/8-shazam-song-identification.png" /></p>
<p>Introverted design is pulled from introverted traits that elegantly influence designs. I firmly believe that using these traits and converting them into appropriate skills could help designers with a different outlook. To practice introverted design, we need to perform the same process with additional intentions that are driven like an introvert:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify nuances of human behavior:</strong> Introverts are expert observers. <ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> Exceed the obvious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overthinking an action:</strong> Introverts are prone to overthink.<ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> Ponder and analyze data beyond the convention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Identify Risks:</strong> Introverts take calculated risks.<ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> Carefully consider decisions to pave the path with the slightest possibility of failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make it objective by practicing active listening:</strong> Introverts are great listeners.<ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> Active listening will help designers comprehend and build better products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make it invisible:</strong>Introverts prefer alone time to recharge.<ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> Create highly intuitive products by focusing on the need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Help the user when needed:</strong> Due to their inwardness, introverts have a hard time asking for help.<ul>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong>  Intervene and provide necessary information when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subtlety:</strong> Introverts prefer using precise words to convey thoughts.<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Drive high impact by being eloquent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The design does not need to be bold, but it needs to be elegant. To use an introverted design, we first need to understand the introverted personality. I am a proud introvert, so I highly recommend a great resource — Jenn Granneman’s ‘<a href="https://introvertdear.com">Introvert, Dear</a>,’ an award-winning community of introverts. Commonly mistaken for shyness, introverts are highly effective people.</p>
<p>The way introverts deal with and interact with the world is nimble. Observe your surroundings, and you will notice so much information that you usually do not perceive. Be articulate using appropriate words and real examples. Listen first, talk later; it helps formulate thoughts better. Speak only when you have something to contribute; otherwise, you are not adding any value to the conversation. Be a critical thinker. All this will help you learn more about how introverts look at the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes a different perspective is all we need to make a difference.</p>

<p>Everything surrounding software documentation is tough — from allocating time to do it to keeping it up to date. Documentation success is tricky to achieve, and often there isn’t enough time to measure impact. That’s because they don’t bring a tangible impact to the end-user experience. We are incapable of putting value on great documentation. Because of that, not rarely do the efforts to create and maintain delightful documentation overweight the time investment and proper planning.</p>
Penny Or Dime
<p>Software Developers are in the business of writing code and content (well, most of us 😉). We can easily justify our salaries when benchmarked versus the features we ship and the revenue coming in through them. So when it comes to writing and educating our peers about those features so they become more capable of interacting with their code, we often question the value of those minutes in opposition to shipping the next feature or fixing that nasty bug right there. There’s so much technical debt, so why are we writing about code that we need to refactor?</p>
<p>We save those minutes immediately — it’s an obvious choice. Right back to code. And we just saved ourselves a few pennies of time. Fast forward a bit; a colleague needs to jump into it and implement a change. You’re out (working on the next big thing, in a meeting, on vacation, or maybe you left the company!), and there are no docs. Those pennies start to accumulate interest now. Luckily, there are a few comments in the code. Good to know that <code>src</code> actually means <code>source</code>, and <code>function sort(a, b)</code> takes two integers. But the reasoning is not really there, so let’s keep digging. The pull request has no description, <code>git blame</code> doesn’t help because who wrote the code isn’t around. I guess it’s time to play detective and reverse engineer stuff. Those pennies are dimes now. Describing has a much smaller cognitive overload than investigating. So the cost to develop our app is rising with developer time, task by task.</p>
<p>Documentation is a hygiene task. We do it to keep things tidy, comfortable, and ergonomic. They are a direct catalyzer of Developer Experience, for better or for worse. And Developer Experience determines how much focus developers can put on the code that really matters instead of working their way out through the weeds.</p>
Brushing Teeth
<p>Hopefully, we all can agree that brushing our teeth is something important to be done every day. It is not the kind of habit that we can do it all on Friday and compensate for days skipped. And in this case, documentation is kind of similar. Of course, we can write it all by the end of the quarter, but it will be way harder and more time-consuming. For instance: do you remember what (or why!) you coded three months ago?</p>
<p>The cognitive overload of documenting things grows from the time you ship the code. Ideally, documentation is like writing tests (which we all do!), and every time we change something, we update the docs.</p>
Remove Obstacles
<p>Unfortunately, most of us fail to create the habit of writing documentation — this is because the workflow is often full of friction. We finish the code, close the file (or the IDE, or the project), and jump onto a Markdown editor (or Jira, or a Wiki, etc.), and now we need to find the right place to put the knowledge we have just created, submit it to review — others will tell us if we picked the best spot, if we wrote it clearly enough, etc. Meanwhile, the code can’t wait — our users are already getting that shiny new feature. (<em>If that’s you, tough! Been there, done that. You have my sympathy.</em>)</p>
<p>As the process proceeds, the decisions raise questions. And yes, practice makes perfect — but ideally, we wouldn’t need to spend such big amounts of time (and energy!) to effectuate due diligence. This friction is working against us in maintaining the habit, and the time we spent finding the spot to put the code has drained our motivation.</p>
Connect the Moving Pieces
<p>As usual, the developer's solution to a friction problem is <strong>automation</strong>. Elude the tedious and repetitive work by making them derivative. <a href="https://swimm.io?utm_source=smashing_mag&amp;utm_medium=paid_pubication&amp;utm_campaign=launch_jan&amp;utm_content=smashing_mag_launch">Swimm</a> accomplishes that by making a few of those many decisions for you in what they call a "documentation ecosystem" — a very appropriate naming.</p>
<ol>
<li>Where to put the documentation? Right there, with the code.</li>
<li>When to write the documentation? As you implement it. Or when you open the PR (at the latest!).</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, you write a method; you explain the method right then and there. The “magical” part comes when, because they’re collocated, it is possible to directly document the parameters and variables <em>in the code</em> to the text in the docs. That way, when the code changes, the documentation is aware it is now outdated and can flag your whole team about it.</p>
<p>All this neat automation requires a little setup and possibly a few changes to your coding interfaces and related processes.</p>
<h3>Code to Docs</h3>
<p>If you use either VS Code or one of JetBrains' IDEs, it is possible to have an extension/plugin integrated. Once writing the code,  a “Swimm wave” will show up next to the code that’s already documented, so you can follow the link and edit the code in an enhanced Markdown editor. This editor has some interesting auto-completion inspected from your code (start typing a variable name, and you’ll see it autocomplete); use it as much as possible since this is the mechanism to link your code to your documentation. </p>
<h3>Versioning To Docs</h3>
<p>With GitHub, once documentation is coupled with the code, reviewing also happens in the same PR. The integration bot is capable of identifying <strong>Smart Tokens</strong> across the code changed and flags either adjustments already made (prompting to review right then and there) or untouched ones (also prompting to review). With individual comments that look more like PR prompts, your PR reviewers can approve each comment section one by one, depending on how comfortable they are with them.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/code-documentation-streamlined/swimm-github-PR-reviews.png" /></p>
<p>Additionally, with automatic checks (Swimm’s patented Auto-sync), it is also possible to set automatic approvals and notification triggers, or mute them completely. So your team can avoid notification overload and tune how they are made aware of changes in a way it suits them best.</p>

These metrics are used by Google to evaluate the quality of user experience. LCP measures the time it takes for the browser to load the main content in the viewport. </p>
<p>Since recently becoming a ranking factor, this major web performance KPI is still a new concept for many web developers. It becomes especially tricky to optimize <strong>when the LCP element is an image</strong>.</p>
<p>To address this problem, I’ll provide an overview of the best practices for the integration and optimization of an LCP image. I’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to improve the LCP <em>Resource load time</em> subpart with the help of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and a focus on proper LCP image sizing.</li>
<li>Some explanations on the browsers’ behavior for this <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and its attributes, so you can really understand and integrate your LCP image correctly.</li>
<li>How to improve LCP <em>Resource load delay</em> subpart.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the explanations will be illustrated by an example that we will iterate on. The images used in the article’s Codepen demonstrations will be integrated with <a href="https://www.twicpics.com/">TwicPics</a> to save time in their creation and speed up the optimization of the LCP metric.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The other LCP subparts are “Time to first Byte” and “Element render delay,” which will not be covered here. Read this “<a href="https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/">Optimize Largest Contentful Paint</a>” article by Philip Walton and Barry Pollard to learn more about the four LCP subparts and their relation to each other.</em><br /><em>If you want to find out how to identify the LCP element on your web pages, check out this <a href="https://www.twicpics.com/blog/how-to-find-the-lcp-element-a-complete-guide">guide</a> by Laurent Cazanove.</em></p>
Improve LCP Resource Load Time With The Help Of The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Tag
<p>The goal here is to decrease the loading time of your LCP image as much as possible without compromising its visual quality. To succeed in this operation, one of the key points is to <strong>let the browser choose the best-suited version of the image</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of declaring a single image file via the <code>src</code> attribute — whose dimensions would be identical for all users across any devices — we need to let the browser choose the image file best suited to each context. This approach allows images with smaller dimensions to be downloaded for users on smaller devices. This way, the image loads faster, and your website will get a better LCP score.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e912754e-e730-4b7e-9072-17de698e244b/4-optimizing-image-element-lcp.png" /></p>
<p>To do this, we need to give the browser the information it needs using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and its <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>srcset</code> attribute points the browser to a list of image files, with a description of their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size">intrinsic width</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>sizes</code> attribute tells the browser the intended display width of the image. It can be combined with CSS media queries to select the appropriate image for the width of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag could be used instead of <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to allow the browser to load different images depending on device characteristics, such as the width of the viewport or image format compatibility. For simplicity, we will only use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in our examples.</em></p>
<h3>The <code>srcset</code> Attribute Of The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Tag</h3>
<p>The <code>srcset</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag indicates a list of image files and their intrinsic width. The browser uses this list to choose the image that it thinks is best suited to the users’ context. </p>
<p>This makes the <code>srcset</code> attribute the first step towards optimizing your LCP image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img srcset="" src="" alt="" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To declare this list of images, it is recommended to follow a <strong>mobile-first</strong> approach. That means first declaring the smallest image as the default option with the <code>src</code> attribute and then declaring it again within the <code>srcset</code> attribute, followed by the larger dimension variants.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ff2eca08-f45e-4094-978a-57a509749ffc/3-optimizing-image-element-lcp.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>intrinsic width</strong> of each image, <strong>expressed in pixels</strong>, should also be indicated using the unit <code>w</code> (<code>w</code> for "width"):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img
  src="image-300.png"
  srcset="
    image-300.png 300w,
    image-900.png 900w,
    image-1800.png 1800w" 
  alt="Image description"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Our example above defines three images (<code>image-300.png</code>, <code>image-900.png</code>, and <code>image-1800.png</code>) separated by a comma, with respective intrinsic widths of 300, 900, and 1800 pixels. To respect the mobile-first approach, <code>image-300.png</code> is the default image here, defined in the <code>src</code> and <code>srcset</code> attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>When using the <code>srcset</code> attribute, it is important to keep the <code>src</code> attribute, so the browser knows which is the default image and to ensure that it is displayed on browsers that do not support the <code>srcset</code> attribute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>It is also possible to use the <code>srcset</code> attribute by declaring the Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) of images rather than their intrinsic width; however, this approach will not be discussed here.</em></p>
<p>Knowing the user’s context, the browser can now choose the image to load from the list declared in the <code>srcset</code> attribute. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1d45560d-830b-440b-bd67-5d3430eb4fe3/5-optimizing-image-element-lcp.png" /></p>
<p>However, in order to avoid unexpected results, we need to understand how the browser selects the best-suited image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the <code>srcset</code> attribute, the browser always chooses the image <strong>according to the viewport size</strong>; it ignores the image display dimensions. Consequently, your CSS styles and media queries have no impact on its choice. You will also have to keep in mind the <strong>landscape orientation</strong> of mobiles and tablets when defining the list of images.</li>
<li>By default (without the <code>size</code> attribute being specified), the browser chooses the image, assuming it is intended to occupy <strong>100% of the viewport width</strong>. </li>
<li>As the browser knows the resolution of the devices, it also <strong>adjusts for the Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)</strong> in its calculations. Therefore, to optimize the LCP image, it will also be necessary to <strong>define a variant for each DPR</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these behaviors, the default formula applied by the browser to choose the image according to the viewport width is:</p>
<p><code>viewportWidth x 100% x DPR</code></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>When no image in the list matches the calculation, the browser will choose the closest match. In case of a tie, the browser selects the larger image.</em></p>
<p>Let’s illustrate the browser’s behavior with an example using our previous code: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;img
  src="image-300.png" 
  srcset="
    image-300.png 300w,
    image-900.png 900w,
    image-1800.png 1800w"
  alt="Image description"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>👉 See live: <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/LYrVeYm/bc493820d1618f435d00d7c809882973">Codepen demo 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>In your browser development tools, open the <code>Network &gt; Img</code> tabs to see the image chosen by the browser according to each viewport and DPR.</em></p>
<p>The image in this demo is displayed at a fixed width of <code>280px</code> on all devices. But on a <code>900px</code> wide screen with <code>DPR 1</code>, the browser will search the <code>srcset</code> attribute image list for an image that is:</p>
<p><code>900px (viewport width) x 100% (viewport width occupied by the image by default) x 1 (DPR)</code></p>
<p>In this case, the browser is looking for an image <code>900px</code> wide.</p>
<p>In our example, while the display width of the image is <code>280px</code>, the image with the intrinsic width of <code>900px</code> will be loaded anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e1d4253-3981-40b1-a928-cfa32a6f0304/1-optimizing-image-element-lcp.png" /></p>
<p>We can see from this example that the images declared within our <code>srcset</code> attribute are not adapted to the display width of <code>280px</code> on all devices. </p>
<p>While the browser applies the formula <code>viewportWidth x 100% x DPR</code> to pick the image to load, we can use a simpler formula to generate the different images declared in the <code>srcset</code> attribute:</p>
<p><code>imageRenderedSize x DPR</code></p>
<p>Taking into account DPRs 1, 2, and 3 on <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/LYrVeYm/bc493820d1618f435d00d7c809882973">our first demo</a>, we would need to create and define the following three images:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DPR 1</strong>: <code>280 x 1</code> =&gt; an image <code>280 pixels</code> wide;</li>
<li><strong>DPR 2</strong>: <code>280 x 2</code> =&gt; an image <code>560 pixels</code> wide;</li>
<li><strong>DPR 3</strong>: <code>280 x 3</code> =&gt; an image <code>840 pixels</code> wide.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, update our code : </p>
<pre><code>&lt;img
  src="image-280.png" 
srcset="
    image-280.png 280w,
    image-560.png 560w,
    image-840.png 840w"
  alt="Image description"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>👉 See live: <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/LYrVeRB/fb316fa8e41d263f20b0312a5023de08">Codepen demo 2</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the updated code is not fully optimized for all devices yet.</p>
<p>In fact, for a <em>laptop</em> device with a viewport of <code>1024px</code> and DPR 2, the optimal image should be an intrinsic width of <code>560px</code> (<code>imageRenderedSize x DPR</code>= <code>280 x 2</code>= <code>560</code>). But with this code, the browser will want to load an image of <code>1024 x 100% x 2</code>, i.e., an image of <code>2048px</code>, which does not exist in the <code>srcset</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the <code>sizes</code> attribute can help us solve this issue.</p>
<h3>The <code>sizes</code> Attribute Of The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Tag</h3>
<p>The <code>sizes</code> attribute gives developers additional control over the browser’s behavior, preventing the browser from assuming images occupy 100% of the viewport. This helps to ensure the optimal image will be loaded and, consequently, optimize your LCP metric.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img srcset="" sizes="" src="" alt="" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The <code>sizes</code> attribute is therefore not necessary when the image actually occupies 100% of the viewport.</em></p>
<p>To assign the value of the <code>sizes</code> attribute, we can use and combine the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the image width as a <strong>percentage of the viewport width</strong>, e.g., <code>sizes="50vw"</code>, when the image is responsive (for example, when the CSS <code>width</code> property is defined as a <em>percentage</em>).</li>
<li>Define the width of the image in <strong>pixels</strong>, e.g., <code>sizes="500px"</code>, when it has a fixed display width regardless of the users’ devices.</li>
<li>Use one or more media queries to allow the browser to make the best choice of an image according to different viewports, e.g., <code>sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 800px, (min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw"</code> (with <code>100vw</code> being the default when no media query is applied).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s update our code example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img
  src="image-280.png" 
  srcset="
    image-280.png 280w,
    image-480.png 480w,
    image-560.png 560w,
    image-840.png 840w,
    image-960.png 960w,
    image-1440.png 1440w"
  sizes="(min-width: 768px) 480px, 87.5vw" 
  alt="Image description"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>To know the width of the viewport occupied by the image in percentage, apply the calculation formula <code>(imageRenderedSize / viewportWidth) x 100</code>, e.g., <code>(280 / 320) x 100</code> = 87.5% of the viewport width (<code>87.5vw</code>).</em></p>
<p>👉 See live: <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/bGKdaYE/2d9a5f5a650d29c71d84056cade858e1">Codepen demo 3</a>.</p>
<p>Now with the source code of our <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/bGKdaYE/2d9a5f5a650d29c71d84056cade858e1">third demo</a>, and regardless of the DPR, the browser can load the perfect image:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a display width of <code>280px</code> for a viewport of <code>320px</code> (87.5% of the viewport).</li>
<li>And for a display width of <code>480px</code> on all devices with a viewport of at least <code>768px</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage, if the integration of the LCP image has been correctly carried out thanks to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and its <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes, the optimization of LCP <em>Resource load time</em> should be optimal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>We’ve mainly focused here on properly sizing the LCP image according to the users’ device. For the LCP score and its “Resource load time” subpart to be really optimal, you may also consider compressing your images using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#use_modern_image_formats_boldly">modern image formats</a>, setting far-future cache expiry headers, or even using a CDN to reduce network distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Even if your LCP image is well-optimized and well-integrated within the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, keep in mind that this would not be sufficient if your page contains render-blocking resources such as JavaScript files. Refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWoI9DXmpdk">this talk</a> by Philip Walton to see how you can eliminate unnecessary element render delay.</em></p>
<p>Now let’s see how it is possible to further optimize the LCP score by reducing its loading time.</p>
Improve LCP Resource Load Delay Subpart
<p>In this section, we are going to complete the code example used earlier to see how to load the LCP image as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Don’t Lazy-load The LCP Image Element</h3>
<p>When users browse the internet to visit a website, the LCP image’s loading is often delayed by the lazy loading technique, whether applied by native lazy loading or a JavaScript library. But it’s important to note that this loading delay <strong>is included in the calculation of the LCP time</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, with a lazy-loading JavaScript library, the script must first be loaded in order to load the final image. This additional step contributes to a significant delay in loading the LCP resource.</p>
<p>In other words, lazy loading an LCP image penalizes the LCP score of the web page.</p>
<p>Similarly, progressive loading or <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/jwGxZd">Low-Quality Image Placeholder</a> (or LQIP) is not considered for LCP by Google at the time of this writing. However, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/largest-contentful-paint/issues/71">discussions are ongoing</a> regarding LQIP, so the situation may change in the future.</p>
<h3>Use Priority Hints</h3>
<p>We have just seen that the LCP image must not be lazy-loaded. But how can we prioritize its loading?</p>
<p>To manage the resources of a page, the browser natively applies a loading order according to a priority defined, <a href="https://web.dev/priority-hints/#resource-priority">among other parameters</a>, by the type of the resource. </p>
<p>Images have a lower priority than render-blocking resources. In addition to meaning the resource is fetched with a lower priority, it also means the fetch is actually delayed, as browsers deliberately delay “low” resources initially so that they can concentrate on more critical, often render-blocking, resources. </p>
<p>This means you need to change the browser’s default load order and its behavior towards hero images so that the LCP image <strong>is not delayed</strong> and can be loaded <strong>as soon as the HTML document is received</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the <code>fetchpriority="high"</code> attribute that allows us to modify this loading priority. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="" alt=""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s update our code example. Simply add the attribute to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, and the browser will automatically determine the right version of the image for prioritizing based on the sources declared in the <code>srcset</code> attribute:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img fetchpriority="high"
  src="image-280.png"
  srcset="
    image-280.png 280w,
    image-480.png 480w,
    image-560.png 560w,
    image-840.png 840w,
    image-960.png 960w,
    image-1440.png 1440w"
  sizes="(min-width: 768px) 480px, 87.5vw"
  alt="Image description"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>👉 See <a href="https://codepen.io/twicpics/pen/Poawrwa/7c54b62826b525bd6ce445441facb2bc">the final demo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute also works on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag of the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element. For now, it’s mainly compatible with Chromium but <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7150#issuecomment-1299923593">should be supported by Firefox in early 2023</a>. However, note that you can still use the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute without any downsides: the attribute will be simply ignored by browsers that do not support it.</em></p>
<p>As shown in our demo, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and its <code>src</code> and <code>srcset</code> attributes are present in the initial HTML source code. This means there is no need to preload the LCP resource here, as the browser’s preload scanner can discover it.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The preloading of responsive images is not supported by all browsers, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=imagesrcset">as is the case for Safari</a>: make sure not to use the <code>href</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element so that non-supporting browsers don’t request a useless image. <a href="https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#optimize-when-the-resource-is-discovered">Read this article</a> to learn more about this topic and see when you might need to preload your LCP resource.</em></p>
<p>In this last demo, not only can the browser now know the optimal image required for devices with a viewport of <code>320px</code> and for devices with a viewport of at least <code>768px</code>, but it can also prioritize its loading compared to other resources. As developers, all the points illustrated in this article should therefore help you improve the LCP score of your website.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da8f9086-81de-4b25-87f2-746cafacc775/6-optimizing-image-element-lcp.png" /></p>
Conclusion
<p>In conclusion, here is a summary of the steps required to optimize the LCP image:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the page template for your website has been defined, <strong>create</strong> and <strong>store all the images</strong> needed for <strong>each device</strong> and <strong>each DPR</strong> based on the <code>imageRenderedSize x DPR</code> formula. To simplify this step, you can use the <a href="https://www.twicpics.com/">TwicPics</a> API to generate multiple versions at different dimensions from the high-quality original image.</li>
<li>Use the <code>srcset</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to include <strong>the list of images defined in step 1</strong>, following a <em>mobile-first</em> approach (remembering to put the default image within the <code>src</code> attribute).</li>
<li>Using the <code>sizes</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, combined with the <strong>media queries</strong> as needed, tell the browser the display width the image would occupy according to the different device contexts:<ul>
<li>If the image is <strong>responsive</strong>, define its width as a <strong>percentage of the viewport width</strong> using the formula <code>(imageRenderedSize / viewportWidth) x 100</code>.</li>
<li>If the image is <strong>fixed</strong> for a range of viewport widths, simply define its width in <strong>pixels</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To further improve your LCP score, use priority hints with the attribute <code>fetchpriority="high"</code> to prioritize the loading of the LCP image. And remember not to lazy load your LCP image resource!</li>
</ol>

<a href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe">john-doe</a>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe">john-doe</a> is a concept for a one-page website that was first put out in late 2020, but I only came across it this past year. The idea behind this one is the use of CSS’s <code>:target</code> pseudo-class, which allows you to display different page content based on hash URLs (e.g. <code>#home</code>, <code>#about</code>, <code>#contact</code>, etc) and IDs on page elements.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4a2dc30c-6c17-4a26-ab88-afd68d3b8e2d/54-johndoe.png" /></p>
<p>The only drawback to this method is the fact that search engines generally don’t recognize hash-based URL changes as separate pages. So this is a novelty-type thing that you probably wouldn’t use on anything important.</p>

<p><a href="https://preline.co/">Preline UI</a> is an open-source set of ready-to-use components built on Tailwind CSS. It’s a huge collection of more than 250 components compatible with React and Vue or a plain HTML + Tailwind project.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b015409f-68ea-4a8e-8390-82db61389cf0/56-preline.png" /></p>
<p>All components include dark mode and there are base components (buttons, lists, etc.), navigation components, form components, overlays, and tables. All components are beautifully designed and the docs are quite extensive in demonstrating the different ways the components can be used.</p>
<a href="https://ui-buttons.web.app/">UI Buttons</a>
<p><a href="https://ui-buttons.web.app/">UI Buttons</a> is a unique collection of 100 buttons that feature styles and hover effects you may not have seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is, of course, useful for video streaming like Netflix or Hulu, but also for games, video courses, <strong>social media content</strong>, and real-time communication on Zoom, Google Meet, and so on with automated captioning turned on. That way, however, is the <em>only</em> way for some of us who are hard of hearing — temporarily or permanently — nevermind of how noisy or busy the environment is.</p>

<p>In fact, the environment might not matter that much. Many people <a href="https://preply.com/en/blog/americas-subtitles-use/">turn on closed captioning by default</a> these days to comfortably follow along in the video. Perhaps the spoken language isn’t their native language, or perhaps they aren’t quite familiar with the accent of some speakers, or maybe they don’t have headphones nearby, don’t want to use them, or can’t use them. In short, <a href="https://sebastiangreger.net/2019/02/ux-closed-captions-for-everybody">closed captions are better for everybody</a> and they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngKp9MqUGj8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">increase ROI and audience</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/34c2cc11-3a07-477b-9a59-f5911fdbd91b/2-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Just a decade ago, <strong>closed captioning</strong> would be difficult to come by on the web. Yet, today it’s almost unimaginable to have a public video produced without proper captioning in place. And it doesn’t seem like a particularly complicated task. Isn’t it basically just text flowing over lines, with a few time stamps in between?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn’t have to be. With captions, we can <strong>embed a lot of contextual details</strong> that are somehow lost between the lines when translated from audio to text — be it sarcasm, music information, synthetic voice, background noise, or unexpected interruptions. But first, we need to talk about how subtitles and captions are different.</p>


<p><em>Pssst!</em> This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href="/category/design-patterns">design patterns</a>. It’s also a part of <a href="https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/">Smart Interface Design Patterns</a> 🍣 and is available in the <a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/interface-design-course-vitaly-friedman/">live UX training</a> as well.</p>

Subtitles vs. Captions
<p>At the first glance, subtitles and captions might appear to be the same. In the end, it’s all about conveying information in a textual way. However, as kindly pointed out by Svetlana Kouznetsova in her <a href="https://audio-accessibility.com/book/">book an audio accessibility</a>, they aren’t really interchangeable.</p>
<p>Accordion to Svetlana,</p>
<blockquote><strong>Captions</strong> are considered as part of <strong>accessibility</strong> and designed for deaf people to access aural information in the same language with accessibility elements such as speaker identifications, sound descriptions etc.<br /><br />
<strong>Subtitles</strong>, on another hand, are considered as part of <strong>internationalization</strong> (not accessibility) and designed as a translation from one spoken language to another written language for hearing people who don't understand the original language.</blockquote>

<p>While captions are designed for people with hearing difficulties, subtitles are designed to support hearing people who might not understand the original language. They often lack speaker IDs and sound descriptions and consequently, <a href="https://audio-accessibility.com/news/2020/10/why-subtitles-are-not-accessible-to-me-as-a-deaf-person/">subtitles aren't necessarily accessible</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus both on subtitles and captions, with some general guidelines of how we can improve both. Our journey starts with a general conversation about design conventions for subtitles.</p>
Subtitles Formatting and Design Conventions
<p>Fortunately, there are already <a href="https://www.checksub.com/subtitle/do-good-subtitles-golden-rules/">golden rules</a> of transcription, <a href="https://dcmp.org/learn/captioningkey">best practices</a> as well as an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-guide-to-the-visual-language-of-closed-captions-and-subtitles-2fda5fa2a325">established visual language</a> for <strong>closed captions and subtitles</strong>. When we want to indicate any subtle changes in the background, emphasis on specific words, whispering, or a short pause, we can rely on simple text formatting rules in subtitles to communicate it.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8984f9d8-0080-42ca-8bab-2182914eda79/3-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Gareth Ford Williams has put together a <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-guide-to-the-visual-language-of-closed-captions-and-subtitles-2fda5fa2a325">visual language of closed captions</a> and has kindly provided a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qzjapyaaz5o2j81/Captions%20and%20Subtitles%20Formatting.pdf?dl=0">PDF cheatsheet</a> that is commonly used by professional captioners.</p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://www.checksub.com/subtitle/do-good-subtitles-golden-rules/">generally established rules</a> about captioning, and here are some that I found quite useful when working on captioning for my own video course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide your sentences into <strong>two relatively equal parts</strong> like a pyramid (40ch per line for the top line, a bit less for the bottom line);</li>
<li>Always keep an average of <strong>20 to 30 characters per second</strong>;</li>
<li>A sequence should only last <strong>between 1 and 8 seconds</strong>;</li>
<li>Always keep a person’s name or title together;</li>
<li>Do not break a line after conjunction;</li>
<li>Consider aligning <strong>multi-lined captions to the left</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some minor differences in formatting between different languages (and Gareth writes about them in the article), but the resource can be used as inspiration and a checklist to make sure you don’t forget any fine details.</p>
Captions Natively Integrated In The Content
<p>On their own, closed captions and subtitles are often seen as an <strong>additional layer</strong> that lives on top of existing audio or video content and supports users in addition to that main piece of content. However, what if we designed them to be <strong>natively integrated</strong> into the video player?</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/10eda064-fce0-4c64-b81e-79bbdb04846c/4-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://ethicsfordesign.com/player/?lang=en">Ethics for Design</a> provides a very different video experience: subtitles take a prominent role in the design, with supplementary information about the speaker remaining on the page as the video advances. The text <strong>isn’t hardcoded into the video</strong> but is available separately, being fully accessible for copy-paste, for example. Also, additional materials and illustrations are highlighted as a speaker is speaking.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ef757c4c-7c98-4c85-ba31-76eeb3a8bd5b/5-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/710d9813-0fb0-4678-8669-39204dc42a6a/6-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Another way of natively integrating subtitles in the video is the <strong>on-screen text technique</strong> used in various shows such as <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/living-words-sherlock-text-screen/">Sherlock TV series</a>. The idea there was to provide storytelling through visual text embedded into visuals but also make text messages more accessible without having to show the entire phone screen to viewers. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c7471362-6f72-407c-ba74-1eb0ed93eb15/7-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51a1bcb9-7e1a-482f-a72e-a192b4d65fd6/8-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3cc1d326-0293-4ea7-b8ba-d1f2a577a4d7/9-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>For his thesis at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, Agung Tarumampen was asked to come up with a concept of what sound visualization would look like if we were designing a <strong>first-class experience for deaf people</strong>.</p>
<p>Agung has experimented with <a href="https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/portfolio/living-comic-thanos-vs-iron-man/">Living Comic</a>, with more striking typography, a bit of animation and a comic book style to transform seemingly boring subtitles into an integral visual part of the experience.</p>
<p>It can even go beyond subtitles, though. When there is a fight happening in the video, the <strong>frame of the video player changes its color and starts glowing</strong>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCCpgj7WTFw&amp;ab_channel=AgungTarumampen">result</a> is very dynamic and impressive but probably a little bit elaborate to produce. (Discovered via <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2022/speakers/vasilis-van-gemert">Vasilis van Gemert</a>).</p>
Add Search Within Subtitles and Transcripts
<p>When released, some videos come along with transcripts that are properly edited and broken down into sections. That’s common for <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/catherine_price_why_having_fun_is_the_secret_to_a_healthier_life/transcript?referrer=playlist-the_most_popular_ted_talks_of_2022&amp;autoplay=true">TED videos</a>, where viewers can jump to a specific part of the speech, as <strong>every sentence in the transcript is linked to the time stamp</strong> within the video.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/49cabc93-db80-44f9-8156-827518e9ac71/10-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>With a transcript in place, it’s useful to allow users to search for specific terms in the transcript and jump right there. In TED’s case, viewers can do so with an in-browser search tool. But with most videos that have only subtitles, it’s usually impossible — and easy to fix.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e2e5cfee-77c2-4882-ab57-3cf1ca567107/11-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>As an additional feature for subtitles/captioning settings, we could <strong>enable search</strong> as well. After all, subtitles are just a text file that already includes everything: the content and the time stamps. That’s a great little tool to help users navigate the video faster and more precisely, and it could work similarly to Zoom’s search within an auto-generated transcript (pictured above).</p>
Decouple Audio Track and Subtitles
<p>We might be assuming that viewers prefer to read subtitles in the same language as the original video track, but that’s not necessarily the case. Sometimes subtitles are available in the user’s native language, while the audio track isn’t. Sometimes captioning includes <strong>detailed audio descriptions</strong> in one language but doesn’t have them in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0508e146-3430-4673-9163-d23b42c14060/12-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Also, some users might watch the video with its original audio track by default and then choose subtitles or captioning in a language that fits them best. And, of course, some people might have a strong preference for watching the video in one language but reading subtitles or captioning in another.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/designing-better-language-selector/">design of the language selector</a>, we can allow them to <strong>freely choose their preference</strong> without any assumptions on our end. Whenever possible, decouple settings for the audio track and subtitles/captions.</p>
Allow Multiple Languages At The Same Time
<p>Most video players allow a selection of a single subtitle language. However, if multiple people are watching a movie together, it might be a good idea to consider allowing users to <strong>select multiple languages</strong> at the same time. In that case, various languages would need to appear differently and probably be taking over one line at a time.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30f70b1b-d742-41b1-89d6-cbe47443befe/13-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t make much sense to allow users to select multiple variants of the same language, e.g., <em>English</em> and <em>English with Audio Description</em>. It’s worth stating that the selection of languages might need to be grouped and alphabetized in addition to the most popular languages used on the site. <a href="https://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/why-flags-do-not-represent-language/">Flags aren’t languages</a>, though, so using a flag to highlight a language is a dangerous path to embark on.</p>
Customization Settings For Subtitles And Captions
<p>Where and how should subtitles and captions be displayed? Surely some websites will have specific branding and specific typography, and these design choices would carry over to subtitles as well. However, some fonts might be more appropriate for people with dyslexia, and sometimes font sizes might need to be enlarged.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/11bcf1f6-87cf-4cf9-8fb0-cb58a2dd8d10/14-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWtOFF0iSbo">YouTube</a>, users can select a font used for subtitles and choose between <strong>monospaced and proportional serif and sans-serif</strong>, casual, cursive, and small-caps. But perhaps, in addition to stylistic details, we could provide a careful selection of fonts to help audiences with different needs. This could include a <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2015/03/typefaces-for-dyslexia.html">dyslexic font</a> or a <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">hyper-legible font</a>, for example.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e1abe983-fb91-44be-8ce0-900b1badab72/15-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Additionally, we could display <strong>presets for various high contrast options</strong> for subtitles, and that’s how it’s done on Amazon. This gives users a faster selection, requiring less effort to configure just the right combination of colors and transparency. Still, it would be useful to provide more sophisticated options just in case users need them.</p>
Position of Subtitles
<p>One fine detail that’s always missing in customization settings is the adjustment of the <strong>position of subtitles and captions</strong> on the screen. Often video streaming companies elaborately adjust the position of subtitles depending on what’s currently displayed in the video. On Netflix, for example, Japanese subtitles <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/implementing-japanese-subtitles-on-netflix-c165fbe61989">sometimes appear on the side</a> to not overlap any text or any important details on the video.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/63ff295b-f10c-43e6-9bfa-2dc4607682bc/16-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>On Netflix, viewers can’t adjust the position of subtitles, but it actually might be a very good idea to do so. The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310819123_Online_News_Videos_The_UX_of_Subtitle_Position">research conducted by BBC</a> (pictured below) showed a <strong>significant improvement</strong> when changing the subtitle location from the standard position of <em>within</em> a video at the bottom to <strong>below the video clip</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b3da3c0a-125f-4a7b-b71f-bc7e1ad10ce8/17-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>According to BBC, “additionally, participants responded positively when given the ability to <strong>change the position of subtitles in real-time</strong>, allowing for a more personalised viewing experience.” It’s worth noting that the test was performed with news segments, which is likely to be a slightly different context compared to immersive movies.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8028d163-d720-45d2-ab92-4b3619eba1ff/18-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Some video players provide that level of customization out of the box. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> and <a href="https://www.kmplayer.com/home">KM</a> video players, for example, provide an option to adjust the scale and position of subtitles or captions and even try to synchronize them automatically. That’s the level of customization that is often missing on the web.</p>
<p>In general, having options to <strong>change the font based on a user’s need</strong>, choose presets for the display of subtitles, and allow users to relocate the caption on screen seems like a safe combination of features that subtitles settings need to provide.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b454b588-8714-46e9-b778-558cb6f5928e/19-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This is especially useful in <strong>real-time communication tools</strong> like Zoom or Google Meet, where captions might overlap a shared screen or a photo of a person who is currently speaking.</p>
Captioning Turned On By Default?
<p>If a vast majority of viewers prefer to watch a movie with subtitles or captions turned on, it might be worth considering having them turned on by default. However, that requires an assumption about the preferred language and the type of captioning a user prefers to watch. And viewers who prefer <strong>not to be disturbed by running text</strong> would need to turn them off every time they want to watch a movie.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/555a9741-a267-43b5-bb70-95edf40be144/20-closed-captions-subtitles-ux.png" /></p>
<p>Ideally, a video player would include a <strong>setting to turn on or off captions by default</strong> and respect the user’s choice whenever a user chooses to come back to the site or rewatch a video. Or even further than that, users could <strong>save captioning preferences as presets</strong>, adjusting everything from font size to the location of subtitles on the screen. So rather than turning subtitles on by default for everyone, it could be an opt-in setting that could be set once and then stay a default as long as it isn’t changed.</p>
Wrapping Up
<p><strong>Subtitles and captions</strong> might appear like an obvious and simple design challenge. Still, to improve the experience of viewers, we need to consider everything from formatting, editorial, and design conventions to different ways of <strong>displaying captions natively</strong>, to the location, and customization settings and presets.</p>
<p>The guidelines and ideas listed above might be helpful when you are choosing a video platform for your video content or when you edit captions for your social media content.</p>
<p>And it’s worth remembering: a vast majority of your customers are likely to use some sort of captioning when they watch your content, so it’s worth spending a bit of extra attention to ensure that their experience is as good as it can be — nevermind what capabilities they might or might not have.</p>

<p>Is it controversial to say deep integration of design systems, removing the need to maintain both a code and design version of each component, is the current Holy Grail of Web Design? </p>
<p>Traditionally the “Holy Grail” was the full-height three-column layout, but that is now consigned to history. Similarly, vertical centering can no longer be the punchline of a CSS joke. Even Container Queries, often considered an impossible task, are making their way into browsers.</p>
<p>This historical precedence gives me optimism. People throughout the web industry worked together, both in collaboration and competitively, to gradually, step-by-step, improve the web. To fundamentally improve the way we all work. The same is happening now with design systems. For all the advantages there are, we still have many things to solve. <strong>UXPin is focused on the goal of removing the gap between design and development tools.</strong></p>
<h3>Introducing UXPin’s npm Integration</h3>

<p>We’ve <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/design-code-modern-approach-development-challenges/">written about</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/bridging-gap-between-designers-developers/">our friends</a> at UXPin before, and it’s been really great watching them iterate their product towards bringing designers and engineers closer. Recently UXPin have extended their <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/merge?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_merge_01_23">powerful Merge functionality</a> by adding npm integration, allowing designers to sync React component libraries without requiring any developer input.</p>
<p>Previously Merge required engineers to export the components to UXPin in the build/deployment pipeline... That’s not required when importing components from npm packages.</p>
<p>To understand how this works, we need to step back and look at how UXPin differs from other design tools. Usually, the canvas on which you design is an image. In the past, these were raster and, nowadays, vector, a step in the right direction, but you are still drawing images that are supposed to represent the direction of your product’s look and feel.</p>
<p>When you use your components on the canvas in UXPin, you aren’t drawing rectangles styled to look about right — you are placing the <strong>real components</strong> the developers will use in the end product. This means you can easily prototype fully interactive high-fidelity designs that would previously require coded prototypes, without any coding using the exact same components as the end product. This reduces the gap between designers and developers both in terms of overlapping effort as well as the gap between what’s designed and what the users interact with.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/85095892-324b-4756-b213-9964de9501bb/image-component-based-design.png" /></p>
<h3>But npm Is For Developers, Isn’t It?</h3>

<p>Let’s be clear: you do not need to install anything on your computer to import component libraries into UXPin using npm integration. You don’t need to write any code. All you need is an existing package hosted on npm. This may be a package that is open source and widely used, such as Ant UI or Material, or it may be specific to your company and already in use by developers.</p>
<p><strong>Node Package Manager (npm) is a tool for importing specified versions of code.</strong> Developers use this for managing versions of “packages” of code that someone else has written. For example, they would tell it which version of React to download, and if a new version is released, they can update it when they are ready. This is basically an <strong>automated way to avoid copying and pasting zip files everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>With UXPin’s npm integration, you can grab the components from npm packages and use them within the design tool.</p>
Okay... How Do I Use It?
<p>Within UXPin, you define the UI component library by adding a new library to the “Merge: Component Manager” section. You will be given options and need to select “Import React Components with npm integration.” Here you will be asked to write the name of the library, and this can be anything. You will also need the package name and version (which can be <code>latest</code>), the path to the styling assets, and any permissions you wish to set up. For a more thorough explanation, <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/docs/merge/npm-integration/?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_docs_12_22">see the documentation</a>.</p>
<a href="https://www.uxpin.com/merge/npm-integration?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_cta_12_22"><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d13c13ab-0aeb-4d7d-8d01-242c45b6b8f1/uxpin-how-it-works.gif" /></a>Import npm package with UI component on <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/merge/npm-integration?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_cta_12_22">UXPin’s trial</a>.

<p>Once that’s complete, you will have imported your component library from npm into UXPin!</p>
<p>This is not the end of the process, however. With the components imported, you need to configure the Merge Component Manager for the library you’ve imported. You need to specify each component individually and set up each of the properties that relate to it.</p>
<p>Although the setup, especially of a large library, can be quite a lot of effort, it really is worth putting in the time upfront to reap the rewards of an integrated design system. At this point, you will be able to build prototypes that are as realistic and true to the medium of the web as any prototype can be. If you want to avoid the integration process and use open-source solutions, you can also use built-in libraries of <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/integrate-with-ant-design-npm/?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_antdesign_01_23">Ant design</a> and <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/merge/mui-library?utm_source=partnerships&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=smashmagazine.com_uxpin_muilibrary_01_23">MUI</a>.</p>
<img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/68d40858-a9f5-458e-a305-c5564a2c370a/npm-integration-coded-components.gif" />Try code-based libraries that are built-in in UXPin.

This Sounds Great, But Is It Suitable For My Team?
<h3>Your Developers Already Have An npm Package For Your Design System</h3>
<p>This is the perfect situation for an integrated design system. A common situation is to create components both in code and a design tool and aim to sync them. Documentation tools such as Storybook are often used to provide shared knowledge and a source of truth between designers and developers. With npm integration, you are able to further reduce the handover process by literally using the same technologies without the step in the middle.</p>
<h3>Designing Without Access To Developers</h3>
<p>If you’re in the discovery phase for a new project and don’t yet have access to any developers just yet, UXPin gives you an advantage. You can prototype using open-source component libraries (for example MUI) and adjust them to your needs. When developers join the team those components can be swapped out for the ones you design from scratch and developers then code.</p>
<h3>Fully-Fledged Team With Existing Practices</h3>
<p>In a seasoned team, changing your tools can be the last thing anyone wants to do and can be hard to agree on. But even for these teams, the reward of having a consistent, integrated solution for sharing components between designers and developers is likely worth the investment.</p>
Conclusion
<p>The team at UXPin has taken an impressive step towards making their Merge technology more accessible with npm integration. With each new Merge release, we can see their vision of how teams can work more closely together with their design systems integrated throughout their process. We can see the future, and gradually we are getting there just as we did with their walking away from the vector-based design standard into working closer with devs. It was a long journey, but worth it in the end.</p>

Without this ritual, the web application cannot really exist. It is not “ready to go live,” a web developer would say. This ritual is the implementation of authentication.</p>
<p>You may have been through this ritual multiple times. But do you <em>really</em> understand what is happening?</p>
<p>This article is my attempt at making this ritual less obscure. It shouldn’t have to take a wizard to implement a good authentication system. Just a good banker!</p>
Your Password Matched. Now What?
<p><strong>Authentication is the process of attributing a given request to a unique entity</strong>, usually a person. It then enables authorization, the process of allowing (or not) said person to access a resource, be it a web page or an API endpoint.</p>
<p>I will focus on the part I’ve always found the most difficult to understand: what happens after the user just submitted the login form and their credentials were confirmed as valid by the backend. </p>
<pre><code>  app.post("/login", async (request, response) =&gt; {
    const { body } = request;
    const user = await getUserByCredentials(body.username, body.password);
    if (user) {
      // NOW WHAT???
    }
</code></pre>

<p><em>Your typical login endpoint. This article is about what happens afterward.</em></p>
<p>We are going to talk about tokens, CORS, cookies, and headers. Those concepts are sometimes quite abstract. To make them more real, I’ll take a shot at a banking analogy.</p>
Authentication Relies On Tokens Like Banks Rely On Money
<p>Let’s consider two common patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON Web Tokens aka JWT.</strong><br />It’s an open standard. You’ll find useful resources at the bottom of this article if you want to go further.</li>
<li><strong>Session-based authentication.</strong><br />It’s a pattern more than a standard. So the implementation may vary, but I’ll try to give an overview of how it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a front-end developer, you may have no control over this design decision, so it’s important that you understand how both work.</p>
<p>As a full-stack or backend developer, you have control over this choice, so it’s even more important that you understand what you are doing. I mean, it’s kinda your job :)</p>
<h3>A JWT Is Like A Banknote</h3>
<p>With <strong>JSON Web Token-based authentication (JWT)</strong>, during the login step, the server will pass the client a token that contains encrypted information, a “claim.” When the client makes a request, they pass this token alongside the request.</p>
<p>The server verifies that this token is indeed a valid token that it itself generated earlier. Then the server reads the token payload to tell who you are, based on a user ID, username, email, or whatever the payload is. Finally, it can authorize or refuse access to the resource.</p>
<p>Think of tokens as banknotes. A banker can print new banknotes like a server can create tokens. Money lets you buy things, or if I rephrase, it lets you access paid goods and services. The JWT lets you access secure services the same way.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4de02b2c-1f33-4239-80f5-ee8264c76fcc/4-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to use your money, either at the bank to credit your account or in a store, people will double-check that your banknotes are real. A real banknote is one that has been created by the bank itself. When the banknote is confirmed to be legit, they can read the value on it to tell how many things you can buy.</p>
<p>JWTs work the same, the server can verify that they indeed created this token earlier, so it’s a real one, and then they can read the payload it contains to confirm who you are and what your permissions are.</p>
<p>Revoking a token can be hard. The server has to maintain a list of blacklisted tokens that are no longer valid, like the bank would need to list robbed banknotes’ unique numbers.</p>
<h3>Session-Based Authentication Is Like A Credit Card</h3>
<p>From the front-end developer standpoint, the main difference between JWT and session-based authentication lies in what the server will return in case of a successful login. </p>
<p>In session-based authentication, instead of having a claim full of user information, you just get a “session id.”</p>
<p>From the backend developer’s standpoint, session-based authentication involves an additional database collection or table to store the sessions. A session is just an object very similar to the JWT, which can contain, for instance, a user id and an expiration date.</p>
<p>This means that the server keeps a lot of control over the authentication. It can log a user out by removing the session from the database, whereas it cannot destroy JWTs, since it doesn’t store them.</p>
<p>Session-based authentication is comparable to credit cards. You go to the bank to open your account. The banker will check your id and issue a credit card with an expiration date. This is the authentication process.</p>

<p>The credit card itself has barely any value: it’s just plastic and a microchip whose purpose is to uniquely identify your account. It can easily be revoked by the bank, usually after a certain period of time, but also when you declare your card stolen. </p>
<p>When you want to pay for something, the store will communicate with your bank to check that your credit card is valid and has a positive balance.</p>
<p>When you access an authenticated resource, the server will check if the session id matches an open session and then if this session matches a user that is authorized to access this resource.</p>
Tokens Are As Precious As Banknotes And Credit Cards. Don’t Get Them Stolen!
<p>It’s easy for companies and banks to store money. They have those big reinforced-steel safes with alarms and sometimes even dragons. Likewise, it’s easy for servers to talk securely to one another. </p>
<p>But websites are like private persons. They can’t have dragons, so they have to imagine specific approaches to store their precious tokens.</p>
<h3>Where Do You Store Your Money?</h3>
<p>Whatever the pattern you pick to authenticate users, JSON web tokens and session ids are precious things. In the remainder of this article, I will treat them similarly, apart from a few technical subtleties. I’ll call either of them the “authentication token,” the thing you show the server to prove that you are authenticated, like money for paying stuff.</p>
<p>Since you have to pass the token alongside every request you make to the server — you need to store it somewhere on the client side.</p>
<p>Here, I’d like to focus more specifically on the case of websites, where the web browser is in charge of sending the requests. You’ll find many articles and documentation in the wild that do not clarify whether they apply to server-server communication or browser-server. The latter is a trickier, uncontrolled context that deserves its own specific patterns.</p>
<p>So, the banker just handed you either a new credit card or a bunch of banknotes. Where do you stash them? In a compartment concealed in the heel of your shoe, in your mailbox, beneath your mattress, or maybe, in your fancy fanny pack?</p>
<h3>Not All Requests Are Born Equal: Loading A Web Page vs. Calling An API</h3>
<p>We can divide authenticated content into two categories: web pages and API endpoints. From a technical standpoint, both are server endpoints. The former returns HTML content or files, the latter — any kind of content, often JSON data. They differ in the way they are consumed.</p>
<p>Web pages are accessed via a web browser that triggers GET requests automatically, depending on the current URL. </p>
<p>APIs are called using JavaScript code. This reliance on APIs and JavaScript is at the core of the Jamstack, REST, and Single-Page-Application philosophies.</p>
<p>Thus, let’s differentiate two use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to <strong>secure access to the web page</strong> itself. Meaning the user can’t even see the structure of your page or any HTML.</li>
<li>You want to <strong>secure calls from your web page to your API</strong>. Anyone can see your web page structure, but they can’t get any data.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you combine both, unauthenticated users can’t see the page structure and can’t get any data from your API.</p>
<h3>Use Case 1: Securing A Web Page Access With Cookies</h3>
<p>I’ll cut it short, to secure web page access, you have no other choice but to use cookies, ideally HTTP-Only, secure cookies.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ffc9abe1-eead-40d3-b3c9-6e74ba5e9a01/3-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, a cookie is a piece of data that should be sent alongside every request to a specific domain. They are part of the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty broad scope. When a website cookie popup differentiates “essential cookies” from other cookies, those essential cookies are often dedicated to authentication. The others are just a way to keep track of the product pages you’ve visited to later shove them in your face to the point of literally optimizing the billboard displays in your neighborhood as if you really, really wanted to buy two freezers within the same month.</p>
<p>Setting a cookie is possible in both directions. Client-side JavaScript can set cookies to be sent to the server. That’s how advertisement tracking works (though GDPR is forcing advertisers to use server-side logic more and more these days). </p>
<p>But the server can also tell the browser to store a cookie using the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header in the response. </p>
<p>This convenient feature lets the backend set what we call “HTTP-only” cookies: cookies that cannot be read by JavaScript. And “secure” cookies are only set through HTTPS for better security. </p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: <em>Using HTTP-only cookies prevents XSS attacks (script injection to steal the token) but not CSRF attacks (forging requests on behalf of your authenticated users, basically impersonating them). You need to combine multiple strategies to parry all possible attacks. I invite you to read more on these topics if you manage a non-trivial website.</em></p>
<p>During the authentication process, the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header should be used in response to the “login” request so the client becomes authenticated via a token.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/588a49e9-4e23-4962-926f-f0a5325195f3/5-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>Cookies are like a wallet. You can store fidelity cards in it and a picture of your cat, but also duller things, like your money. It’s in your pocket or your handbag, so it’s hard to access for other people (HTTP-only, no JavaScript access) if you don’t take it out in unsafe places (secure). Yet, you always have your token with you if needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e19a0377-4a0b-420f-a9a2-357fbdf0c170/9-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>Browsers rely a lot on cookies, and they send them automatically alongside every request they trigger as long as the domain and path match, so you don’t have to worry about them. If you carry your wallet with you anytime you go out, you’re always ready to pay.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8bdba247-4fa0-4ba7-9a10-9fb89b2e5146/8-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<h3>Use Case 2: Securing API Calls. The Cookie Scenario</h3>
<p>Now, let’s authenticate calls to our API, which feeds the website with data. The easiest option would be to use a cookie, as we did in the previous section, to secure web pages. But contrary to the web page, there is also another option — using web storage. Which one is the most suited is debatable. Let me start with cookies.</p>
<p>The cookie that contains the auth token is sent automatically alongside requests triggered by the browser when you navigate a website or when you submit a form.</p>
<p>But requests triggered by JavaScript code do not fall into this category. When you trigger a request programmatically, you need a bit more configuration to send cookies.</p>
<p>Remember that the cookie should be HTTP-only, so you can’t read the cookie content with JavaScript nor inject your token in the <code>Authorization</code> header. You could do that with a cookie that is not HTTP-only, but then using a cookie doesn’t make sense in the first place.</p>
<p>All existing libraries capable of sending requests have to be based on the browser JavaScript API  aka the “Browser Object Model,” which means either <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or <code>fetch</code>. You have to rely on their configuration to enable sending HTTP-only cookies alongside the request.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>fetch</code>, this option is named <code>credentials</code>. Hopefully, for you, fellow front-end developers, it’s very easy to use.</p>
<pre><code>fetch(
"http://localhost:8000/account/signup", 
{ 
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({username:"foo", password:"barbar"}), 
  // This will include credentials (here, cookies) in the request
  credentials: "include"
})
</code></pre>

<p>With XHR, the option is named <code>withCredentials</code> and behaves similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Your server must also confirm that it indeed accepts credentials by setting the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> header to true in the responses. This option is symmetrical. It controls both sending cookies to the server, but also accepting the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header from it. So don’t forget to set it to true for the call to the login endpoint.</em></p>
<p>If the <code>credentials</code> option is not set and the server answers with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header… the browser will silently ignore this attempt to set the cookie without even a warning. When this happens, start by double-checking your <code>credentials</code> option and then CORS if applicable (see next section).</p>
<p>Oops, I’ve almost forgotten your banking analogy! It’s a tough one but let’s say that you probably have your credit card or a few banknotes always there in your wallet. But some services expect a prepaid card, and you may need to explicitly remember to take them with you. <em>That’s the best analogy I could achieve. Comment if you can do better!</em></p>
<h3>Return Of Use Case 2: Securing API Calls. The Web Storage Scenario</h3>
<p>Remember, I said earlier that for API calls, you have the choice to either store the token in an HTTP-only cookie, like you would do to secure a web page, or to store the token in the web storage. By web storage, we mean either <code>sessionStorage</code> or <code>localStorage</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve seen and used both approaches, cookies and web storage, but I sincerely don’t have the expertise to assert that one is better than the other. I’ll stick to describing how it works so you can make an enlightened decision.</p>
<p>Codewise, they are much easier to use than HTTP-only cookies because web storage is available to JavaScript code. You can get the token from the login response payload, store it in <code>localStorage</code>, and insert it into the <code>Authorization</code> header in later requests. You have full control of the process without relying on some implicit browser behavior.</p>
<pre><code>headers: {
    “Authorization”: `Bearer ${window.localStorage.get(“auth_token”)}`
}
</code></pre>

<p>Web storage is immune to certain attacks, namely Cross-Site Request Forgery. That’s because, contrary to cookies, they are not automatically tied to requests, so an attacker will have trouble forcing you to give your token. Think of a piggy bank. You can’t just get money out of it. It’s, however, very sensitive to script injection, where an attacker manages to run JavaScript and reads the token.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you go the web storage way, you’ll want to explore strategies that prevent XSS attacks from happening in the first place.</p>
<h3>JWT Specifics: What Information They Should Contain And How To Handle The Refresh Token</h3>
<p>You should avoid storing critical information in a JSON web token, even when using HTTP-only cookies. If someone still manages to steal and decrypt the token, they will be able to impersonate the user, but at least they won’t be able to get much information from the token itself. </p>
<p>You can afford to lose a five-dollar banknote; it’s more problematic to lose a $5,000 banknote. By the way, if such a thing as a $5,000 banknote exists, please send me a specimen to prove it. Thank you.</p>
<p>JWTs are meant to be short-lived, like banknotes, which would wear quickly when used a lot. Since they are hard to revoke, giving them 5-minute lifetime guarantees that even a stolen JWT token cannot be a big problem.</p>
<p>Since you don’t want the user to log in again every 5 minutes, the token can be combined with a longer-lived refresh token. This second token can be used to get a new JWT. </p>
<p>A best practice is to store the refresh token in a cookie on a very specific path like <code>/refresh</code> (so it’s not sent with all requests, contrary to the JWT) and to make it a one-time-only token. </p>
<p>A refresh token is like bringing your ID card to get more money from your bank account. You don’t do that often, and you probably want to store your ID even more safely than your banknotes. </p>
CORS Is How Shops Communicate With Their Bank
<p>Formally, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a protocol used by servers in order to instruct browsers to selectively relax some of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) restrictions on network access for some trusted clients.</p>
<p>Less formally, the server can tell your browser that the request you send is legit based on the request’s origin. If the server says it’s not legit, the browser won’t send the request.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>https://www.foobar.com</code>, <code>https://qarzed.fake</code>, and <code>http://localhost:8080</code> are possible origins. The port and protocol matter. </p>
<p>An API hosted on <code>https://api.foobar.com</code> will most often allow requests only from <code>https://www.foobar.com</code> and <code>https://mobile.foobar.com</code>.</p>
<p>I will focus here on API calls triggered with <code>fetch</code> in JavaScript, and only if the API lives in another Web origin. CORS also affects more advanced use cases like embedding images from another website in your own website, iframe, navigating from one site to another, and so on, but that’s beyond the scope of authentication per se.</p>
<p>Websites are like stores. People can enter them and try to buy things. But the store also has its own complicated internal back office logic. Namely, it relies on a bank to process payments. </p>
<p>Any shop owner can try to connect to any bank. Any website can try to connect to any API. But the payment won’t be processed by the bank if they don’t have a company account there.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/23751d53-0163-4d34-92ee-3ab34ff70461/7-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>Likewise, if you host the website on <code>www.foobar.com</code> and the API on <code>www.foobar.com/api</code>, there is one origin only <code>www.foobar.com</code>. No need for CORS because there is no “cross-origin” call involved. You’ll need to bother about CORS if, instead, you host the API on <code>api.foobar.com</code>. We have two distinct origins, <code>api.foobar.com</code> and <code>www.foobar.com</code>.</p>
<p>This also applies to using different ports on <code>localhost</code> during development. The IP <code>127.0.0.1</code> is even different from <code>localhost</code>, as origins are compared directly as strings and not based on their actual IP address.</p>
<p>Some big companies, like car sellers, have their own internal bank. It’s easier for them to communicate with this bank if it’s literally located in the same office. They are like full-stack monolithic applications.</p>
<p>But if this internal bank is located in a different country (API separate from the website), this doesn’t work anymore. It could as well be a traditional bank with multiple clients (a third-party API). CORS is needed either way.</p>
<p>CORS is a concept specific to browser-server communication. When a server talks to another server, the Same-Origin Policy doesn’t apply. The API may either block those requests with no origin completely or, on the contrary, accept them, or filter them based on IP and so on. </p>
<p>Banks have specific patterns of communicating with each other that are different from how they communicate with their client companies.</p>
<h3>A Polite Cross-origin Discussion Between A Server And A Client, Using Preflight Requests</h3>
<p>Here’s a more concrete vision of what happens during a cross-origin request and how the server response headers should be set.</p>
<p>From the browser standpoint, whenever a website sends a “non-simple” request to an API, the browser will first send a preflight request. It’s a request to the same URL but using the OPTIONS method, which is dedicated to checking whether you can actually consume this API endpoint.</p>
<p>Fetching JSON data falls into this “non-simple” category in standard browsers, as well as calling your login endpoint if the auth API doesn’t live on the same domain as your website, so this step is extremely important.</p>
<p>The server receives this request, which includes an Origin header. It checks its own list of accepted origins. If the origin is allowed, it will respond with the right <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header.</p>
<p>This server header should match the website’s origin. It can also be a wildcard <code>*</code> if the API is totally open, but that works only for requests without credentials, so forget about this if your API requires authentication. </p>
<p>If the response header doesn’t match, the browser will trigger an error at this point because they already know that they can’t call this API. Otherwise, they will keep going and send the actual request.</p>
<p>A store (the API) can decide to accept only certain types of credit cards. Some stores accept only their own card, and they don’t even use CORS (same-origin scenario). Some stores accept only Visa or Mastercards (cross-origin scenario). The cashier (the browser) won’t let you pay if they are told your card is not accepted by the store.</p>
<p>There are a few other <code>Access-Control</code> headers that provide more information, like accepted methods or headers. <code>Allow-Origin</code> is the most basic one, as well as <code>Allow-Credentials</code>, so cookies and <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers are properly enabled when using <code>fetch</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Access-control-allow-origin: https://www.foobar.com
Access-control-allow-credentials: true
</code></pre>

<p><em>Expected response headers for an authenticated call (or the “login” form submission) if the website lives on <code>https://www.foobar.com</code> and the API is on another domain or port.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The server specifies the CORS policy, and the browser enforces it. If suddenly everyone used an unsafe browser run by pirates, they could swarm your server with forged requests. Hopefully, people usually don’t use a shady browser they found in a USB key itself found lying on the ground of a dark alley at 3 am.</em></p>
<p>The header things and the browser behavior are just politeness. The browser is an excessively polite software. It will never spam the server with requests that will be rejected anyway. And it won’t talk to rude servers that don’t set the proper headers. That’s why the <code>Accept-Control-Allow-Origin</code> response header must be correctly set for cross-origin requests to work.</p>
<p>Before going as far as aiming a customer with a shotgun, the banker will probably tell you, “sir, you entered the wrong bank office,” and the customer will probably answer, “oh, sorry, my mistake. I will leave immediately!”.</p>
<h3>Cookies Or Not Cookies: The SameSite Option</h3>
<p>Setting the <code>credentials</code> attribute in your <code>fetch</code> request is not enough for sending the cookie, plus it doesn’t apply to pages, only to programmatic requests. The <code>SameSite</code> attribute of cookies lets you configure when a cookie should be sent, depending on the current site.</p>
<p>The concept of “Site” is slightly different from the concept of domain:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://api.foobar.com</code> and <code>https://www.foobar.com</code> are 2 different domains. </li>
<li>They are, however, the same site. Nowadays, the scheme matters, too (HTTP vs. HTTPS).</li>
<li>There is an exception to this rule, e.g., in multi-tenant architectures: <code>foo.github.io</code> and <code>bar.github.io</code> will be different sites despite having the same domain, and the server owner can configure that to their will.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>Access-control</code> response headers are correctly set, and the preflight request succeeds, the browser will proceed with the actual request.</p>
<p>But if <code>SameSite</code> is not set with the right value in the cookie containing the authentication token, this cookie won’t be sent to the server. When loading a page, you will be considered unauthenticated by the server just because it literally doesn’t have your cookie.</p>
<p>The <code>SameSite</code>: <code>Lax</code> value is usually the most appropriate. It will only send cookies to the same site but also when the user comes from another site and is redirected to your page (only for top-level navigations). This is the current default in most browsers.</p>
<p>With <code>SameSite</code>: <code>Lax</code>, the website <code>www.foobar.com</code> will automatically include the authentication cookie when it sends requests to <code>api.foobar.com</code>, which is part of the same site. Authentication will work as expected.</p>
<h3>Sec-Fetch Helps Detecting Cross-origin Requests But Are Not Standard Yet</h3>
<p>Related to CORS, you may also hear about the <code>Sec-Fetch</code> request headers. They provide information about the request context to the server. For instance, if <code>Sec-Fetch-Site</code> is <code>same-origin</code>, there is no need to check the Origin header. It’s slightly more intuitive than manually checking the request origin against predefined rules. If it’s <code>same-site</code>, you still need to add the required CORS headers in the response because the site and the origin are different concepts.</p>
<p>However, those headers are not sent by all browsers. Namely, Safari doesn’t support them at the time of writing. Therefore, they can only act as a secondary solution to identify a request’s origin.</p>
<p>A bank can identify you via your passport, but not everybody has a passport, so you will always need to resort to a good old ID card. Passports are still a cool way to identify people when available. That’s what the <code>Sec-Fetch</code> headers are.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that attackers may trick users into sending requests they don’t want to, but they still have no control over which browser will send the request. Thus, <code>Sec-Fetch</code> headers are still useful despite being supported only by some browsers. When they are present, they are a reliable piece of information.</p>
<p>More broadly, cross-origin and cross-site security patterns are based on the fact that users are using legitimate browsers that should never try to voluntarily mislead servers about the origin. Beware of more elaborate attacks, such as subdomain takeover, that can still bypass these security measures.</p>
<p>You may think, what about servers, then? Server requests are able to spoof a request origin, effectively bypassing CORS. Well, that’s right: CORS is a browser-server security mechanism; it simply doesn’t apply to server-server calls. Someone can build an API that calls your own API and serve the result to another website. True.</p>
<p>However, the thief will have to host a server, which isn’t free, so they will pay actual money for this API call, and the server IP may be traced back to them. It’s way less attractive than forcing browsers to send the request directly to your API, which would be free and trace back to the first victim, your user, and not to the attacker. Thanks to CORS, this worst-case scenario is not possible.</p>
No, We Don’t Take Checks: Don’t Confuse A Web Page Access And An API Call
<p>If you’ve stumbled upon this article, you have probably read a lot of documentation before that. You might have encountered various patterns that seem very different from one another and may be very different from what I’ve been describing so far. </p>
<p>I’d like to point out that this article is about authentication for <em>websites</em>. This is, I believe, the root of all confusion. First, the requests are sent by a browser, not by another server. Then, a page of a website can be accessed via the URL bar, and the website can send calls to an API via JavaScript; that’s two very different situations.</p>
<p>We have detailed the technical differences between each scenario earlier in this article. But let’s recap again to better understand the most common sources of confusion.</p>
<h3>Using Browser Storage (Session, Local, And Friend) Is Like Using Your Mailbox As A Piggy Bank</h3>
<p>Setting your token in <code>localStorage</code> is like storing money in your physical mailbox. Well, technically, it’s safe. It’s even used to temporarily store your mail. Session storage is similar; it’s just like getting your mail every day instead of letting it rot for weeks. Be nice to the postman!</p>
<p>But either way, the storage is accessible to JavaScript. It’s not open like your mailbox most probably has a lock. But it’s still lying outside. </p>
<p>Someone who is really mean could craft a key and go as far as discreetly stealing your mail for days. That’s what would happen to your users if someone manages to run a script injection attack in your application. They can craft a JS script that reads the <code>localStorage</code>, and sends them the tokens of any of your users affected by the breach!</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d7b386e4-00b5-4f4b-8846-1ab39fbd73f4/6-authentication-websites-banking-analogy.png" /></p>
<p>There are ways to prevent cross-scripting attacks. It’s not a fatality, and some would argue that it’s still better than using an HTTP-only cookie! But if you go the web storage way, don’t forget to protect your mailbox. </p>
<h3>JWTs Passed As Header: It’s A Pattern For API Calls Only</h3>
<p>I’d like to go one step further and understand <em>why</em> so many developers are tempted to use the browser storage without even considering the cookie option.</p>
<p>I think there are two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The API doesn’t use <code>Set-Cookie</code> during the login step. It often happens in APIs that were not specifically designed to be accessed from a browser, and they use an authentication pattern that works for servers, too (so no cookies). Your back-end developer will claim it was a “design choice.” Don’t trust them.</li>
<li>The client needs to set an <code>Authorization</code> header with the token. That’s just the symmetrical issue; the API chose not to rely on cookies.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll meet a lot of documentation in the wild that shows headers like this:</p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Setting the <code>Authorization</code> header implies you cannot use an HTTP-Only cookie. Of course, you can set the headers of a request using JavaScript. However, this means that the token must be available to JavaScript in the first place. Let’s repeat it once again: <strong>it’s ok not to use a cookie and prefer web storage, but be very careful with XSS attacks!</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, this pattern works only for programmatic requests with fetch and XHR. You can’t secure access to the web page itself because the browser won’t set this header automatically during navigation. You just really can’t. </p>
<p>If you need to secure web pages, the backend of your website (which may differ from your actual API that serves data) should use HTTP-only cookies, or you should set a non-HTTP-only cookie manually. Either way, be careful that by using cookies, you are introducing a new vector of attacks.</p>
<p>Not all websites need to be secured this way, though. It’s actually pretty uncommon for public-facing websites. Remember Blitz.js’ motto “secure data, not pages.” But the cookie way is still a pattern you must be aware of.</p>
<p>If you really need to secure a web page, reach out to your backend developer and explain to them that cookies are good. They won’t contradict this claim.</p>
<p>If it’s really not possible to improve the API, you might want to adopt a pattern named “backend-for-frontend” (BFF). Basically, have a tiny server owned by the front-end team that takes care of calling authenticated APIs server-side, among other things. It works pretty well with frameworks like Remix or Next.js that have built-in server-oriented features.</p>
<h3>Side Note On Basic Auth: Looks Like A Header, Behaves Like A Cookie</h3>
<p>Of course, every rule must have its exceptions. There is only one common scenario I know where the token can be passed as a request header without using JavaScript: using basic authentication. </p>
<p>Basic authentication is an unsafe pattern, as identifiers are sent alongside every request, not just a token but the actual username and password. It’s a bit like asking your local drug dealer to pay your rent and give them your ID card and 2000$ that they should kindly bring to your landlord. It’s only ok if this is a fake ID. Actually, no, fake IDs and drug dealers are not ok. But you get the point!</p>
<p>It’s still interesting for a few use cases, like quickly securing the demo of a website. As long as you can accept the password to be stolen without that many consequences, typically if the password has been generated by an admin for a temporary occasion (NOT a user-set password that could be reused for multiple services!).</p>
<p>In basic authentication, the browser sets the <code>Authorization</code> header for you. You still need to set the <code>credentials</code> option properly when using <code>fetch</code> programmatically so that the header is also set in this case. But you don’t have to manually tweak the header. It really behaves like a cookie.</p>
<p>That’s actually one reason why this fetch option is named “credentials” and not just “cookies”: it also applies to the basic authentication header.</p>
Conclusion
<p>Wow, if you’ve read this far, you definitely earned your right to a quick summary! </p>
<p>But before that, I have another gift for you: <a href="https://github.com/lbke/deno-auth-demo">an open-source demo of authentication with Deno and HTMX for the front end</a>!</p>
<p>This is a very basic setup, but it puts the concepts described in this article into action using the “cookie way.”</p>
<p>Here is your well-deserved TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JWT is like banknotes, and sessionId is like credit cards.</strong> They are two authentication patterns, but either way, you want to store those tokens safely client-side.</li>
<li><strong>One safe place to store tokens in a browser is an HTTP-only and secure cookie, set via the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header of the login response.</strong> It cannot be stolen by malicious JavaScript code. Web storage is another possibility if you only secure API calls and not web page access. If you pick web storage, then be very careful with XSS attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies are automatically sent alongside every request provided you use the right options</strong>, namely the <code>path</code> and <code>SameSite</code> attributes of the cookie. Like a wallet, you would carry it on you all the time and take it out of your bag only in safe places when a payment is needed.</li>
<li><strong>When navigating via URL, the browser takes care of sending the cookie containing the auth token (if properly set).</strong> But you may also need to call authenticated APIs using JavaScript code. Fetch <code>credentials</code> and XHR <code>withCredentials</code> options have to be configured correctly, so cookies are also sent alongside those programmatic requests. Don’t forget to set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> response header as well.</li>
<li><strong>Auth is about politeness: the server must set the proper headers for everything to work.</strong> You can’t enter a bank and yell at people to get your money.</li>
<li>This is particularly true for cross-origin requests. Companies must have secure and polite discussions with their bank, which can be separate organizations or located in a distant country. That’s what CORS is for websites and APIs. Don’t forget to properly <strong>set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> and <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> headers</strong> in the response.</li>
<li>If you store your savings in your mailbox, put a camera on top of it, and <strong>if you store your token in the web storage, protect it against XSS attacks</strong>.</li>
<li>Banks don’t treat people like they treat other banks. <strong>Don’t confuse webpages patterns</strong> (have to rely on cookies and browser’s built-in features) <strong>and API patterns</strong> (relying on headers, which can be implemented using client-side JavaScript).</li>
<li><strong>Basic auth is a fun pattern that blurs the line, as it uses an Authorization header like for APIs, but it can be used for webpages too.</strong> It’s a specific and very insecure pattern that is only meant for a handful of limited use cases. Basic auth headers are a reason why <code>fetch</code> and <code>XHR</code> options are named “credentials” and not just “cookies.”</li>

Why? Data visualization is a method of communication. Using the right type can help you quickly convey nuanced information to your audience in a visually appealing way. However, the diversity of styles used in both digital and print formats can be overwhelming. In this article, we will break down the most common visualization types to help guide you through selecting the best choice for your specific needs. </p>
<p>Before getting into the content of the article, let’s briefly address language usage. “Graph” and “chart” are often used interchangeably, but specificity is important. In this article, the term “graph” refers to visual representations of data on a Cartesian plane (they often look like a grid and have an x-, y-, and sometimes z-axis). “Chart” is used as a catchall word for visual representations of data. It’s like the relationship between squares (graphs) and rectangles (charts); all graphs are charts, but not all charts are graphs. </p>
<p>With this understanding, we can dive into the considerations involved in selecting a chart type. </p>
How To Choose The Right Chart Type
<p>There are some questions you should consider when choosing the right data visualization for your purposes, and we’ll dive into each of these in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What message am I trying to communicate with the data?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of the data visualization?</li>
<li>Who is the audience?</li>
<li>What type and size of data set am I working with?</li>
</ul>
What Message Am I Trying To Communicate With The Data?
<p>Each data visualization should have a primary message. Having a clear idea of what you want to communicate and focusing on that will increase the overall quality of your data visualization, and it will help you narrow down chart types based on the complexity of the message and/or the amount of information being communicated.</p>
<p>For instance, sometimes, a simple table is enough to communicate a singular idea. However, if the message is more complex and/or meant to empower or motivate the audience to take action, it is worth thinking about more dynamic chart types. The following example of this guidance is based on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stetsondone/video-game-sales-by-genre?resource=download&amp;select=genre_region_totals.csv">dataset created by Stetson Done</a> on Kaggle. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d1d1e17a-c40e-45d3-923b-a625e678df82/worldwide-video-game-sales-by-genre-table.png" /></p>
<p>The pared-down dataset is shown as a table. In one column, there’s a categorical variable (genre) and in the other is a quantitative variable (sales). The categories are sorted by sales rather than alphabetically by genre. This makes it easy to glance at the table and get an idea of what the most popular genres are. As an added bonus, the table takes up relatively little space. If the purpose of the data visualization is to communicate simple information about the popularity of various video game genres from 1980-2020, the table in Figure 1 is a good choice. But what if the information is more complex?</p>
<p>The following chart shows a table created with the same dataset but which shows slightly different information. Instead of eight genres, this table shows five, and instead of the total worldwide sales for each genre, it presents sales figures for two regions: the European Union and North America. The message this table is trying to communicate is twofold: the data speaks to the sales of various video game genres in two regions and presents a comparison of the sales across these two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/afc11e01-613c-4439-bb2e-649f7106b6dd/regional-video-game-sales-table.png" /></p>
<p>In this format, comparing sales for a genre between the two regions is very straightforward. However, comparing sales across all genres for each region is more complicated. The result is that the latter part of the message isn’t being communicated as effectively.</p>
<p>By changing the type of data visualization we use, we can effectively communicate more information. The following figure displays the same data and the table but in the form of a grouped bar graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/370a44c0-bc86-45bc-841f-a93e2a605497/video-game-sales-grouped-bar-graph.png" /></p>
<p>The bar graph allows the audience to compare each genre across the two regions and to compare sales of all the genres for each region. Because the bar graph communicates more information than the table in Figure 2, it’s a better choice for this data. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that less is more. When selecting a chart type, try to create a data visualization that’s as simple as possible while effectively communicating your intended message(s) to your audience. </p>
What Is The Purpose Of The Data Visualization?
<p>In the field of data visualization, there are four largely accepted categories of data visualization that relate to different purposes: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#comparison">Comparison</a></li>
<li><a href="#composition">Composition</a></li>
<li><a href="#distribution">Distribution</a></li>
<li><a href="#relationship">Relationship</a> </li>
</ol>
<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>How are the elements similar or different? This can be among items and/or over time. </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Comparing the sales of two different brands of dog food in a single retail location.</em></p>
<p>Comparison charts include alluvial diagrams, area graphs (stacked), bar graphs (simple, floating, grouped, and stacked), box and whisker plots, bubble graphs, bullet charts, donut charts, gauge charts, line graphs, parallel coordinates, pie charts, proportional area charts, proportional symbol maps, radar charts, radial bar charts, tree maps, Venn diagrams, and word clouds. To learn more about each of these charts, check out the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">Chart reference guide</a>, one of two resources provided as a companion to this article.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/92528095-b32d-4418-8d59-7db35a3e8683/comparison-decision-tree.png" /></p>
<h3>Composition</h3>
<p>What parts make up the whole? The composition can be static or change over time. </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Showing the breakdown of the diet of Pallas cats.</em></p>
<p>Composition charts include area graphs (stacked), bar graphs (stacked), circle packs, donut charts, network diagrams, pie charts, tree diagrams, and tree maps. To learn more about each of these charts, check out the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">Chart reference guide</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d70ffa53-1936-490c-9eec-010e734995e7/composition-decision-tree.png" /></p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>Where do the values in a data set fall? Are there outliers? </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Communicating the distribution of grades within a middle school class, including the average and outliers.</em></p>
<p>Distribution charts include alluvial diagrams, bar graphs (floating), box and whisker plots, bubble graphs, bullet charts, circle packs, choropleth maps, connecting line maps, histograms, proportional area charts, proportional symbol maps, scatterplots, and word clouds. To learn more about each of these charts, check out the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">Chart reference guide</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8e7d1e1e-9f6e-4bfe-94d5-72fbd352f5f1/distribution-decision-tree.png" /></p>
<h3>Relationship</h3>
<p>How do the elements relate to each other? Is there a correlation? </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Showing how colder temperatures are correlated to fewer ice cream sales.</em></p>
<p>Relationship charts include alluvial diagrams, bubble graphs, circle packs, connecting line maps, heat maps, histograms, line graphs, network diagrams, parallel coordinates, radar charts, scatterplots, tree diagrams, and venn diagrams. To learn more about each of these charts, check out the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">Chart reference guide</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e936fe5-a18f-461f-9ef5-5a9404b3e69a/relationship-decision-tree.png" /></p>
<p>Some chart types fall into multiple categories. For instance, tree diagrams can provide information both on what elements make up a category and on the relationships between those elements. A classic example is a site map. Site maps communicate a list of the pages within a site (composition) and the relationships between the pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/04fb0659-9f08-447d-99c9-05ffb157c11b/tree-diagram-composition-and-relationship-copy.png" /></p>
<p>A donut chart is another good example. Figure 5 shows the results of a second-grade class being asked what their favorite animal is.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1be26fcb-47a9-40d0-907e-336a2a519da3/donut-chart-favorite-animals.png" /></p>
<p>Not only does Figure 5 give you a complete listing of the favorite animals selected by the class, but it also allows you to compare the popularity of those animals. Thus, it achieves both comparison and composition.</p>
<p>Multi-purpose charts don’t have to be used for multiple purposes, but when you do want a single chart that can do more than one thing, these types of charts can be a good choice. You can learn more about which chart types are multi-purpose, including what types of variables they use in the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Data-Visualizations-Table.pdf">Data visualizations table</a>, one of two resources provided as a companion to this article (reference Figure 12). </p>
<p>Knowing what the purpose of the data visualization is will help narrow the options down significantly. If you find that you have multiple purposes and/or messages that can’t be communicated in a single multi-purpose chart, consider using multiple charts, especially if your audience is less familiar with data visualizations and may have trouble reading a more complex chart type. For more information on different chart types, including their purpose, when to use each, and an example, refer to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">Chart reference guide</a>.</p>
<p>That brings us to the next consideration in choosing a chart type — audience.</p>
Who Is The Audience?
<p>Knowing your audience is key to effective communication. For our purposes, knowledge about your audience will be immensely helpful in both selecting the type of data visualization you’ll use as well as deciding various aspects of the design. </p>
<p>When considering your audience, it’s important to think about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How familiar they are with the subject matter of your data.</li>
<li>How much context they already have versus what you should supply.</li>
<li>Their familiarity with various methods of data visualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information should help inform your selection of chart type. For instance, some data visualization types are quite complex and should only be used with high-level experts in the field and/or individuals who are very familiar with data visualizations. For more information on which chart should only be used with this type of audience, refer to the “When to use” sections of the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/data-visualization-sara-dholakia/Chart-Reference-Guide.pdf">reference guide</a>. The following is an example of one set of data communicated with two different chart types.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/329a6f53-b918-48e8-a255-beaa8d189ad2/audience-example-radar-chart.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fbf2aa00-b4a6-46a7-92b6-45139022044b/audience-example-bar-graphs.png" /></p>
<p>Both charts communicate the same skill ratings for two individuals across five categories. Figure 6 uses a radar chart. While these can be a good tool to communicate comparative data, many audiences aren’t familiar with this chart type or with the circular format in which they present the data. As such, Figure 6 may be more difficult for many people to read than Figure 7. </p>
<p>Figure 7, on the other hand, uses a grouped bar graph to display the same data. Since grouped bar graphs are familiar to most people regardless of their familiarity with data visualization, it’s more likely to be easier to understand by a larger audience. </p>
<p>If you’re wondering, “Why not always opt for the simpler chart type,” you’re not alone. <strong>Simplicity is key, but it should be looked at from the perspective of the bigger picture.</strong> Some chart types, while more complicated for a general lay audience to understand, communicate information more successfully for audiences that are familiar with them. This is evident in Figures 6 and 7. While radar charts are likely more difficult for a random person to read, in this case, the radar chart, for someone who can easily read it, does a better job of allowing for a comparison across the two people.  </p>
<p>Considering your audience will be important after you’ve selected your chart type as well. For a general audience — not composed of experts — you should use simple, straightforward language and avoid using jargon or technical terminology. Additionally, for general audiences without a lot of background knowledge on the topic of your data, you may want to include more contextual information before introducing the data visualization or provide context and additional information within the visualization. </p>
<p>A stacked area graph is a good example of this. Stacked area graphs are like simple area graphs. The difference is that they show two or more data series stacked on one another. Each data series after the first one starts where the one before it ends. In other words, if point A for data series 1 stops at $18 million, then point A for data series 2 will begin at $18 million. </p>
<p>For this reason, they can be a bit confusing if you’re not familiar with them, and if they aren’t labeled, reading them can require some math. However, the benefit of using them is that they show the values for each series as well as the totals (for each point, the top of the stack is the total). Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate this.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5dc7a20-efb1-44d5-b1bd-e46f4b8d2177/stacked-area-graph.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d80a0303-7adc-40e4-a141-0064887a8a7a/stacked-area-graph-with-details.png" /></p>
<p>Both Figures 8 and 9 show a stacked area graph with the same data. However, Figure 9 provides additional information by labeling the values for each region for each quarter. This not only eliminates the need for the audience to calculate the figures, but it also helps to illuminate a characteristic of stacked area graphs. Because of the way they’re laid out, it can be difficult to compare the values for the different data series (in this case, regions) at a single point, for instance, Quarter 1. Adding the values to the graph helps with that. However, it’s not always a good idea to label every element in a graph. Doing so with large data sets often results in a graph that’s overcrowded and harder to read (see Figure 10).</p>
<p>By this point, the types of charts still under consideration should have narrowed significantly based on your message, purpose, and audience. Based on your remaining options, it’s now largely a matter of matching up the details of your data set, including the type and number of variables for the remaining options. </p>
What Type And Size Of Data Am I Working With?
<p>There are different types of data and variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative</strong>: numerical (like population size or temperature).<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous</strong>: numerical data can take any value between two numbers (ex: weight or temperature).</li>
<li><strong>Discrete</strong>: numerical data that, unlike continuous data, has a limited number of possible values and includes finite, numeric, countable, non-negative integers (ex: the number of people who have been to space).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ordinal</strong>: non-numerical data that has a natural order (ex: days of the week or spiciness levels on a menu (mild, spicy, very spicy)).</li>
<li><strong>Categorical</strong> (aka nominal): categories that don’t have an inherent order or numerical values (ex: oak, ash, and elm trees; pink, purple, and blue).</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing what type of data you plan to use in your data visualization will help you eliminate some chart types. For instance, if your data consists of a categorical and a quantitative variable, you can’t use a histogram because they show frequency and quantitative variables split into intervals. </p>
<p>Similarly, the size of your data set can help you to eliminate some chart types. Certain data visualization types like bar graphs and pie charts only lend themselves to being used with a small set of data. The reason is that charts should communicate a message in a way that’s easy to understand. A bar graph with eighteen bars or a pie chart with twenty slices is not going to be easy to read. However, there are chart types that can be used with large data sets. Figures 10 and 11 demonstrate this. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a87e698d-7781-45ac-8a57-a1cd9abb790b/pseudo-random-survey-of-fav-movie-released-2022-pie-chart.png" /></p>

<p>Both charts are based on the same data, but when presented as a pie chart, the information takes longer to process than when presented in a table. Because the pie chart has so many slices, it’s not possible to label each one with the movie title, so we have to use a key. This means that the audience will have to keep scanning from right to left over and over again to look from the key to the pie chart. The table, on the other hand, has the number of votes presented beside the movie title, making it easy to understand not only the popularity of the movies but the exact number of votes each one received.</p>
<p>For more information on which charts work with large data sets and other information about over 30 of the most popular chart types, refer to Figure 12.</p>

User Frustrations In 2023
<p>In this post, I’ve put together a few personal <strong>observations from real usability testing</strong> on how people behave, what they do, and what they don't do on the web. Frankly, the results shouldn’t be very surprising to you, but once put together, they paint quite an astonishing picture.</p>

<p>The most important notion for me (and the most disappointing one) is that users, in general, don’t seem to trust websites. They are often seen as “<strong>hostile</strong>”, “<strong>unfriendly</strong>”, “busy”, “annoying,” and “confusing”. That’s why the default attitude towards any website is pretty much the same: <strong>block everything</strong>!</p>
<p>That’s why pop-ups and modals are often <strong>dismissed instinctively</strong>. So are push notifications, chat window pop-ups, feedback pop-ups and install app prompts. The same also goes for importing contacts or granting access to geolocation, camera, microphone, or photos.
</p>
<p>The blocking happens before users even have a chance to read what they were asked about — and once the request has been denied, there is no way to restore it or open it later. The best way to deal with it is to <strong>always prefer a</strong> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/"><strong>nonmodal dialogue</strong></a>, and also always explain why we need permission before asking for it. Humbly and respectfully.</p>
User Delighters In 2023
<p>A common problem that users often experience is the <strong>lack of control</strong>. Not only do windows appear all-of-a-sudden, requiring users’ immediate attention; users don’t feel that they can rely on the website and fully control their digital experience. This often reflects in words such as “fragile”, “broken”, “confusing”, “poorly done”, “not helpful” coming up.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/68f42548-b9aa-411e-ad04-45f746d90652/ux-delighters-2023.png" /></p>
<p>✅ Calm, fast, accessible experience<br />✅ Large, legible text<br />✅ Large checkboxes and radio buttons<br />✅ Input boxes that look like <a href="https://adamsilver.io/blog/form-design-from-zero-to-hero-all-in-one-blog-post/">input boxes</a><br />✅ Clear focus/active states<br />✅ <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/authentication-ux-design-guidelines/">Simple password requirements</a><br />✅ Large, tappable areas<br />✅ Helpful <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/error-messages-ux-design/">error messages</a><br />✅ Error messages not covering text input<br />✅ Error messages not appearing as toast messages<br />✅ User input persisted on refresh<br />✅ <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/frustrating-design-patterns-mega-dropdown-hover-menus/">Drop-downs opening on tap/click</a><br />✅ Easy undos, edits, cancellations<br />✅ Pausing of auto-rotating <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/04/designing-better-carousel-ux/">carousels</a><br />✅ <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/designing-better-infinite-scroll/">Infinite scroll</a> with a sticky footer<br />✅ Reliable “Refresh” and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/back-button-ux-design/">“Back” buttons</a><br />✅ Videos with playback speed options<br />✅ Videos with a closed captioning option<br />✅ Reliable browser’s auto-fill and password generation<br />✅ <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/frustrating-design-patterns-broken-frozen-filters/">Filters applied manually</a>, with the “Apply” button<br />✅ <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/authentication-ux-design-guidelines/">Magic link sign-in experience</a>  </p>
<p>One of the things that surprised me was the notion of <strong>“calm experience”</strong> that came up frequently. What users seem to mean by that is a <strong>predictable, reliable design</strong>. A design where input boxes appear as input boxes, with large radio buttons and checkboxes, with simple password requirements and helpful error messages.</p>
Wrapping Up
<p>Of course, the observations above might not be quite right in your case. Enterprise environments, for example, are very different and can prompt very different user behavior. However, these insights seem to be quite holistic, with many people behaving in a similar way when <strong>experiencing similar issues</strong>.</p>
<p>What’s really interesting to me is that while user frustrations have evolved and <strong>increased significantly</strong> over the years, the things that users love and appreciate haven’t changed at all. They probably won’t change in the future either, so focusing on them first might be just the right investment for every project in 2023.</p>
<p>When we speak about <strong>design trends in 2023</strong>, perhaps it’s also a good opportunity to think about how we can create slightly calmer, more <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/ethical-design-practical-getting-started-guide/">ethical</a> and inclusive designs, perhaps even being a little bit <a href="https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer">boring</a> every now and again. Frankly, that might feel remarkably refreshing to users in a world that is too noisy, too busy, and too exclusive too often.</p>

<p></p>Open The Doors Of The New Year<p></p>
<p></p><p>“January is the first month of the year and usually the coldest winter month in the Northern hemisphere. The name of the month of January comes from ‘ianua’, the Latin word for door, so this month denotes the door to the new year and a new beginning. Let’s open the doors of the new year together and hope it will be the best so far!” — Designed by <a href="https://www.popwebdesign.net/index_eng.html">PopArt Studio</a> from Serbia.</p><p></p>

<p>But what does this exactly mean?</p>
<blockquote>“When people zoom a page, it is typically because they want the text to be bigger. When we anchor the text to the viewport size, even with a (fractional) multiplier, we can take away their ability to do that. It can be as much a barrier as disabling zoom. If a user cannot get the text to 200% of the original size, you may also be looking at a WCAG 1.4.4 Resize text (AA) problem — check out Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 due to incorrect use of viewport units to resize text.”<br /><br />— Adrian Roselli</blockquote>

<p>The prominent example that demonstrates the problem is a <a href="https://codepen.io/pprg1996/pen/yLONLPv">simple demo</a> from Adrian Roselli’s article, “<a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html">Responsive Type and Zoom</a>.” Make the viewport width to 800px and see how text gets smaller while zooming to 220%. If you continue zooming, the text will begin to increase again, but will never reach its 2× increase in size (browsers currently have a zoom limit of 500%). </p>

<p>When I started to study this question intently, I found out that there is no solution at the time as well as detailed explanation. The great recommendation is: </p>
<blockquote>“If you are going to use responsive typography techniques anyway, you must test it by zooming. Zoom across devices, across browsers, across viewport sizes (not everyone surfs full-screen), and across viewport orientations.”<br /><br />— Adrian Roselli</blockquote>

<p>So, if you want to be sure that the user will be able to zoom in the text to at least 200% of original size, you should make a huge amount of tests. In this article I propose the solution <strong>how to predict</strong> the mentioned WCAG Failure at the stage of development. And I am not sure that my findings will guarantee the 100% absence of the problem, but I am sure that it will be helpful to avoid developers from rough errors in the real use cases.</p>
Not Responsive Typography
<p>So, what is really going on when users try to zoom the web page? The answer to this question is very simple: <strong>All modern browsers assume that pixel is stretchable</strong>. Therefore, the screen size “effectively” decreases on zooming.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: This article was written a few months ago, and OMG, Firefox now zooms pages correctly. The screen size doesn’t “effectively” decrease as you zoom in, but it is constant. Thus, the problem described in the article is still relevant for Chrome, Opera, but not for Firefox. So, while reading, you may find different behavior of the examples depending on the browser.</blockquote>

<p>When we try to zoom the page to 200% of its original size, the pixel becomes twice as large in height and width. So, look at the code below:</p>
<pre><code>p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without zooming, we will see a text of this paragraph as text of some <em>“visual-size”</em>. Due to different physical size of pixels for different devices, this <em>“visual-size”</em> will change from one device to another. Really, if your 42-inch TV has a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels, then it contains 2073600 pixels, and your 6.1-inch iPhone 13, for example, has a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and contains a whopping 2962440 pixels. Let introduce some coefficient <em>k</em> that is proportional coefficient between <em>“visual-size”</em> (what we see on screen) and <em>“font-size”</em> (what we set in CSS):</p>
<p>$$(1)\quad visual\_size=k * font\_size$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/92f35cc1-2cf7-41f9-9944-6623a9563258/1-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>This coefficient depends on type of screen. But as we will see below, it does not effect on a final result. </p>
<p>Now let’s try zoom in and see what happens. </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d56d77eb-f7f6-44ec-aa9a-eb0f9513d875/2-fluid-typography-predict-problem-users-zoom-in.png" /></p>
<p>As we can see, the <code>"visual-siz"e</code> of the text monotonically increases while zooming, and we can describe this by introducing the <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> (browser zoom) as the following:</p>
<p>$$(2)\quad visual\_size=k <em> zoom\_coefficient </em> font\_size$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/04ac74ba-d8d4-490b-ba93-72765442e410/2-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>The <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> is equal to 1 for the original size (without zoom in), 2 — for 200% of browser zoom, 3 — for 300%, and so on, and <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> &lt; 1 when we zoom out. Now we can introduce and calculate a <code>"visible-zoom"</code> coefficient, which is a measure of the real visible increasing (decreasing) of a size of the text, as ratio:</p>
<p>$$\begin{eqnarray}
(3)\quad visible\_zoom&amp;=&amp;\frac{\textrm{size what we see while zooming}\,(zoom\_coefficient\ne 1)}{\textrm{size what we see without zooming}\,(zoom\_coefficient=1)}=\nonumber \\ \\ 
     &amp;=&amp;\frac{(k <em> zoom\_coefficient </em> font\_size)}{(k * font\_size)}=zoom\_coefficient \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/587451d9-480b-434a-ab27-61587c64ac09/3-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>As we can see from equation (3), the <code>"visible-zoom"</code> is equal to browser <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code>. That is, to double the text size (<code>"visible-size"</code> of text), we need to simple apply browser 200% zoom in. So, the mentioned WCAG Failure Under 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA) will never be observed in the case of not responsive typography (constant font size).</p>
Fluid Typography
<p>So, what happens in the case of responsive typography? In the mentioned <a href="https://codepen.io/pprg1996/pen/yLONLPv">simple demo</a> one can find the following record in CSS stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code>h1{
   font-size: clamp(1rem, -0.875rem + 8.333333vw, 3.5rem);
(*)
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is an example of fluid (responsive) typography. Fluid typography give us the possibility to change text smoothly with viewport width. The widespread implementation of such concept in CSS stylesheet is to use a <code>clamp</code> function. Using <code>clamp</code> you can smoothly change <code>"font-size"</code> between <code>"min-value"</code> and <code>"max-value"</code> in the given range of viewport width (from <code>"start-width"</code> to <code>"end-width"</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0d0130d1-26b3-47df-b7de-e70c0ffb6268/3-fluid-typography-predict-problem-users-zoom-in.png" /></p>
<p>In such the case, when font-size value depends on viewport width, equations (2) and (3) can be easily modified. In these equations we should take into account two facts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>"font-size"</code> depends on (function of) <code>"viewport-width"</code>, so <code>"font-size"</code> = <code>"font-size"("viewport-width")</code>;</li>
<li>The value of viewport width depends on <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second fact is not so obvious like the first one. But we should remember that under zooming the viewport width “effectively” decreases. So, we will have the following transformation when zooming:</p>
<p>$$(4)\quad viewport\_width\rightarrow\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c3f9f8bb-575a-4d0a-95b1-75df36e99692/4-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>Using relation (4), equation (3) take the following form:</p>
<p>$$\begin{eqnarray}
(5)\quad visible\_zoom&amp;=&amp;\frac{k <em> zoom\_coefficient </em> font\_size\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}\right)}{k <em> font\_size\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient=1}\right)}=\nonumber \\ \\ \\
     &amp;=&amp;\frac{zoom\_coefficient </em> font\_size\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}\right)}{font\_size\left(viewport\_width\right)} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bbd12499-28aa-4105-92ae-15fafd55106e/5-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>Equation (5) and a simple criterion (“minimum 200% zoom requirement”):</p>
<p>$$(6)\quad visible_zoom\ge 2$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/26401600-76ff-4620-a59f-01c75aef2e27/6-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>can be used to check whatever users can get text to 200% of its original size for the available range of browser zoom (up to 5 or 500% nowadays) for the any value of viewport width. On a practice, it is better to create some 3D plot in coordinates <code>"visible-zoom"</code> — <code>"viewport-width"</code> — <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> or corresponding contour map. Such visualization is an easy way to estimate the extent of the problem if it exists.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let’s apply equation (5) to analyze the <a href="https://codepen.io/pprg1996/pen/yLONLPv">simple demo</a> from Introduction. At first, we can reassemble the <code>(*)</code> record for better understanding of the parent behavior (what developer specified in). Here we will assume that browser’s default font size is <code>16px</code>. The influence of browser default font size on our conclusion will be discussed latter. Keeping in the mind <code>clamp("min-value", "responsive-value", "max-value")</code> function record form, we have from <code>(*)"min-value" = 1rem = 16px</code>, <code>"max-value" = 3.5rem = 56px</code>. Taken into account that viewport width is equal to <code>100vw</code>, we can write two equations to determine <code>"start-width"</code> and <code>"end-width"</code>:</p>
<div>
 <pre><code>-0.875rem + 0.08333333 * "start-width" = 1rem;<br />-0.875rem + 0.08333333 * "end-width" = 3.5rem.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>From these equations one can find that <code>"start-width"= 22.5rem= 360px</code>, and <code>"end-width" = 52.5rem=840px</code>, or represent the result graphically:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8b95b206-9327-4b56-b6e7-661b1bffcc99/4-fluid-typography-predict-problem-users-zoom-in.png" /></p>
<p>To obtain the calculated dependency of <code>"visible-zoom"</code> on <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> at 800px of viewport width where anomalous behavior is observed, we can use equation (5) with fixed value of <em>“viewport-width”</em> = 800px and plot the corresponding curve (by <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">Plotly JavaScript Open Source Graphing Library</a>). Here you can see the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/214d0a13-7cc5-43fe-86ca-5ebd8a3e0bad/7-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>$$\begin{eqnarray}
(7)\&amp;\quad\&amp; font\_size(viewport\_width)=\nonumber\\[5pt]
\&amp;=\&amp;\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    function_1 (viewport\_width),\,viewport\_width&gt;breakPoint_1,\nonumber\\[3pt]
    function_2 (viewport\_width),\,breakPoint_1&gt;viewport\_width&gt;breakPoint_2,\nonumber
  \end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}$$</p>
<ul>
<li>You can exclude it by using the algorithm proposed in <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/fluid-sizing-multiple-media-queries/">my previous article</a> and return to pt. 1;</li>
<li>For given <code>"viewport-width"</code> and <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code>, we should transform the equation (7) to use as numerator in equation (5) like:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$\begin{eqnarray}
\&amp;\quad&amp; font\_size\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}\right)=\nonumber\\[5pt]
\&amp;=\&amp;\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    function_1\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}\right),\,\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}&gt;breakPoint_1,\nonumber\\[3pt]
    function_2\left(\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}\right),\,breakPoint_1&gt;\frac{viewport\_width}{zoom\_coefficient}&gt;breakPoint_2,\nonumber
  \end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}$$</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/600d6e2f-933e-4de5-92e7-1ed0637504ed/8-formula-fluid-typography.png" /></p>
<p>It is your choice how to use equation (5), but I recommend to reduce the task to pt. 1/2(i).</p>
<p>It should be noted that we did not consider operating system zoom here. When user applied it this will also affect on “effective” screen size. As a result, the <code>"zoom-coefficient"</code> should be represented as a product of browser and operating system zoom. Such influence on final prediction will be similar to the case of changing browser default font size.</p>
Conclusion
<p>Now we are able to predict the behavior of text size changing while zooming to avoid the WCAG Failure Under 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA). Equation (5) and <em>“minimum 200% zoom requirement”</em> (6) give us an easy way to anticipate a problem on the stage of development and analyze it. Due to a variety of possible dependencies for a text font size on viewport width that developer can implement, there is no general solution of a problem. But you can slightly change the input parameters and view the predictions. In most cases, such corrections will give the desired result. We should make a choice in favor of completely eliminating possible problems with text scaling.</p>

I don’t use Vim. I find <code>sed</code>, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code> convoluted and counter-intuitive. I prefer seeing my files in a nice UI. Despite all that, I got into the habit of reaching for <strong>command-line interfaces (CLIs)</strong> when I had small, dedicated tasks to complete. Why? I’ll explain all of that below. In this article, you’ll also learn how to use a CLI tool named <a href="https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Miller</a> to manipulate data from CSV, TSV and/or JSON files.</p>
Why Use The Command Line?
<p>Everything that I’m showing here can be done with regular code. You can load the file, parse the CSV data, and then transform it using regular JavaScript, Python, or any other language. But there are a few reasons why I reach out for command-line interfaces (CLIs) whenever I need to transform data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to read.</strong><br />It is faster (for me) to write a script in JavaScript or Python for my usual data processing. But, a script can be confusing to come back to. In my experience, <strong>command-line manipulations are harder to write initially but easier to read afterward</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to reproduce.</strong><br />Thanks to package managers like Homebrew, CLIs are much easier to install than they used to be. No need to figure out the correct version of Node.js or Python, the package manager takes care of that for you.</li>
<li><strong>Ages well.</strong><br />Compared to modern programming languages, CLIs are old. They change a lot more slowly than languages and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
What Is Miller?
<p>The main reason I love Miller is that it’s a standalone tool. There are many great tools for data manipulation, but every other tool I found was part of a specific ecosystem. The tools written in Python required knowing how to use <code>pip</code> and virtual environments; for those written in Rust, it was <code>cargo</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>On top of that, it’s fast. The data files are streamed, not held in memory, which means that you can <strong>perform operations on large files without freezing your computer</strong>.</p>
<p>As a bonus, Miller is actively maintained, <a href="https://github.com/johnkerl/">John Kerl</a> really keeps on top of PRs and issues. As a developer, I always get a satisfying feeling when I see a neat and maintained open-source project with great documentation.</p>
Installation
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>apt-get install miller</code> or <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/linux">Homebrew</a>.</li>
<li>macOS: <code>brew install miller</code> using Homebrew.</li>
<li>Windows: <code>choco install miller</code> using <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, and you should now have the <code>mlr</code> command available in your terminal.</p>
<p>Run <code>mlr help topics</code> to see if it worked. This will give you instructions to navigate the built-in documentation. You shouldn’t need it, though; that’s what this tutorial is for!</p>
How <code>mlr</code> Works
<p>Miller commands work the following way:</p>
<pre><code>mlr [input/output file formats] [verbs] [file]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>mlr --csv filter '$color != "red"' example.csv</code></p>
<p>Let’s deconstruct:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--csv</code> specifies the input file format. It’s a CSV file.</li>
<li><code>filter</code> is what we’re doing on the file, called a “verb” in the documentation. In this case, we’re filtering every row that doesn’t have the field <code>color</code> set to <code>"red"</code>. There are many other verbs like <code>sort</code> and <code>cut</code> that we’ll explore later.</li>
<li><code>example.csv</code> is the file that we’re manipulating.</li>
</ul>
Operations Overview
<p>We can use those <em>verbs</em> to run specific operations on your data. There’s a lot we can do. Let’s explore.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>I’ll be using a dataset of <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data/tree/master/data/2018-11-24_tv-ratings"><em>IMDb ratings for American TV dramas</em></a> created by The Economist. You can download it <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smashingmagazine/command-line-data-manipulation/main/tv_ratings.csv">here</a> or find it in the <a href="https://github.com/smashingmagazine/command-line-data-manipulation">repo</a> for this article.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>For the sake of brevity, I’ve renamed the file from <code>mlr --csv head ./IMDb_Economist_tv_ratings.csv</code> to <code>tv_ratings.csv</code>.</em></p>
<p>Above, I mentioned that every command contains a specific operation or verb. Let’s learn our first one, called <code>head</code>. What it does is show you the beginning of the file (the “head”) rather than print the entire file in the console.</p>
<p>You can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>`mlr --csv head ./tv_ratings.csv`
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the output you’ll see:</p>
<div>

<p>This is a bit hard to read, so let’s make it easier on the eye by adding <code>--opprint</code>.</p>
<pre><code>mlr --csv --opprint head ./tv_ratings.csv
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting output will be the following:</p>

<p>Much better, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Rather than typing <code>--csv --opprint</code> every time, we can use the <code>--c2p</code> option, which is a shortcut.</em></p>
<h3>Chaining</h3>
<p>That’s where the fun begins. Rather than run multiple commands, we can chain the verbs together by using the <code>then</code> keyword.</p>
<h3>Remove columns</h3>
<p>You can see that there’s a <code>titleId</code> column that isn’t very useful. Let’s get rid of it using the <code>cut</code> verb.</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p cut -x -f titleId then head ./tv_ratings.csv
</code></pre>

<p>It gives you the following output:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Fun Fact</strong><br /><br />This is how I first learned about Miller! I was playing with a CSV dataset for <a href="https://details.town/">https://details.town/</a> that had a useless column, and I looked up “how to remove a column from CSV command line.” I discovered Miller, loved it, and then pitched an article to Smashing magazine. Now here we are!</blockquote>

<h3>Filter</h3>
<p>This is the verb that I first showed earlier. We can remove all the rows that don’t match a specific expression, letting us clean our data with only a few characters.</p>
<p>If we only want the rating of the first seasons of every series in the dataset, this is how you do it:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p filter '$seasonNumber == 1' then head ./tv_ratings.csv
</code></pre>

<h3>Sorting</h3>
<p>We can sort our data based on a specific column like it would be in a UI like Excel or macOS Numbers. Here’s how you would sort your data based on the series with the highest rating:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p sort -nr av_rating then head ./tv_ratings.csv
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting output will be the following:</p>
<pre><code>titleId   seasonNumber title                         date         av_rating  share   genres
tt0098887      1       Parenthood                    1990-11-13   9.6824     1.68    Comedy,Drama

</code></pre>

<p>We can see that <em>Parenthood</em>, from 1990, has the highest rating on IMDb — who knew!</p>
<h3>Saving Our Operations</h3>
<p>By default, Miller only prints your processed data to the console. If we want to save it to another CSV file, we can use the <code>&gt;</code> operator.</p>
<p>If we wanted to save our sorted data to a new CSV file, this is what the command would look like:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --csv sort -nr av_rating ./tv_ratings.csv &gt; sorted.csv
</code></pre>

<h3>Convert CSV To JSON</h3>
<p>Most of the time, you don’t use CSV data directly in your application. You convert it to a format that is easier to read or doesn’t require additional dependencies, like JSON.</p>
<p>Miller gives you the <code>--c2j</code> option to convert your data from CSV to JSON. Here’s how to do this for our sorted data:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2j sort -nr av_rating ./tv_ratings.csv &gt; sorted.json
</code></pre>



Case study: Top 5 Athletes With Highest Number Of Medals In Rio 2016
<p>Let’s apply everything we learned above to a real-world use case. Let’s say that you have a detailed dataset of every athlete who participated in the 2016 Olympic games in Rio, and you want to know who the 5 with the highest number of medals are.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flother/rio2016/master/athletes.csv">download the athlete data as a CSV</a>, then save it in a file named <code>athletes.csv</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s open up the following file:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p head ./athletes.csv
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting output will be something like the following:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>id        name                nationality sex    date_of_birth height weight sport      gold silver bronze info

</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Optional: Clean Up The File</h3>
<p>The CSV file has a few fields we don’t need. Let’s clean it up by removing the <code>info</code> , <code>id</code> , <code>weight</code>, and <code>date_of_birth</code> columns.</p>
<pre><code>mlr --csv -I cut -x -f id,info,weight,date_of_birth athletes.csv
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can move to our original problem: we want to find who won the highest number of medals. We have how many of <em>each medal</em> (bronze, silver, and gold) the athletes won, but not the total number of medals per athlete.</p>
<p>Let’s compute a new value called <code>medals</code> which corresponds to this total number (bronze, silver, and gold added together).</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p put '$medals=$bronze+$silver+$gold' then head ./athletes.csv
</code></pre>

<p>It gives you the following output:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>name                 nationality   sex      height  sport        gold silver bronze medals

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Sort by the highest number of medals by adding a <code>sort</code>.</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p put '$medals=$bronze+$silver+$gold' \
    then sort -nr medals \
    then head ./athletes.csv
</code></pre>

<p>Respectively, the resulting output will be the following:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>name              nationality  sex     height  sport       gold silver bronze medals
Michael Phelps    USA          male    1.94    aquatics      5    1      0      6
Katie Ledecky     USA          female  1.83    aquatics      4    1      0      5
Simone Biles      USA          female  1.45    gymnastics    4    0      1      5
Emma McKeon       AUS          female  1.80    aquatics      1    2      1      4
Katinka Hosszu    HUN          female  1.75    aquatics      3    1      0      4
Madeline Dirado   USA          female  1.76    aquatics      2    1      1      4
Nathan Adrian     USA          male    1.99    aquatics      2    0      2      4
Penny Oleksiak    CAN          female  1.86    aquatics      1    1      2      4
Simone Manuel     USA          female  1.78    aquatics      2    2      0      4
Alexandra Raisman USA          female  1.58    gymnastics    1    2      0      3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Restrict to the top 5 by adding <code>-n 5</code> to your <code>head</code> operation.</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p put '$medals=$bronze+$silver+$gold' \
    then sort -nr medals \
    then head -n 5 ./athletes.csv
</code></pre>

<p>You will end up with the following file:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>name             nationality  sex      height  sport        gold silver bronze medals
Michael Phelps   USA          male     1.94    aquatics       5     1      0      6
Katie Ledecky    USA          female   1.83    aquatics       4     1      0      5
Simone Biles     USA          female   1.45    gymnastics     4     0      1      5
Emma McKeon      AUS          female   1.80    aquatics       1     2      1      4
Katinka Hosszu   HUN          female   1.75    aquatics       3     1      0      4
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As a final step, let’s convert this into a JSON file with the <code>--c2j</code> option. </p>
<p>Here is our final command:</p>
<pre><code>mlr --c2j put '$medals=$bronze+$silver+$gold' \
    then sort -nr medals \
    then head -n 5 ./athletes.csv &gt; top5.json
</code></pre>

<p>With a single command, we've computed new data, sorted the result, truncated it, and converted it to JSON.</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    "name": "Michael Phelps",
    "nationality": "USA",
    "sex": "male",
    "height": 1.94,
    "weight": 90,
    "sport": "aquatics",
    "gold": 5,
    "silver": 1,
    "bronze": 0,
    "medals": 6
  }
  // Other entries omitted for brevity.
]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you wanted to show the top 5 women, you could add a <code>filter</code>.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>mlr --c2p put '$medals=$bronze+$silver+$gold' then sort -nr medals then filter '$sex == "female"' then head -n 5 ./athletes.csv
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Respectively, you would end up with the following output:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>name              nationality   sex       height   sport        gold silver bronze medals
Katie Ledecky     USA           female    1.83     aquatics       4    1      0      5
Simone Biles      USA           female    1.45     gymnastics     4    0      1      5
Emma McKeon       AUS           female    1.80     aquatics       1    2      1      4
Katinka Hosszu    HUN           female    1.75     aquatics       3    1      0      4
Madeline Dirado   USA           female    1.76     aquatics       2    1      1      4
</code></pre>
</div>

In short, it’s an <strong>incredible source of diversity</strong>, which makes our interfaces and our front-end work way stronger, more reliable, and more challenging.</p>
The Need For Right-To-Left Interfaces
<p>Most languages, like French or English, are meant to be read for Left-To-Right (LTR). However, in these cases, some languages like Farsi (Persian), Arabic, and Hebrew have a different reading direction — Right-To-Left (RTL).</p>
<p>The question is <em>how</em> can we adapt our interfaces to this huge change? </p>
<h3>Before CSS Logical Properties</h3>
<p>Before CSS Logical Properties, we could make RTL adaptations with different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a dedicated CSS file only for RTL surcharge/layout;</li>
<li>Surcharging only parts that need to be adapted in the same CSS, e.g. <code>[dir="rtl"] .float-left { float: right; }</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if these methods are doing the work — I used the second one to create <a href="https://www.standup4humanrights.org/ar/">an Arabic version of the Stand Up for Human rights website</a> a few years ago — both of them are quite sub-optimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to maintain another file for the first one;</li>
<li>The CSS file for the second one is a bit heavier, and there might be some issues to deal with (specificity, more properties to add, and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p>For sure, we can create huge machinery with Sass to produce several builds and use some tools like UnCSS to remove what is not needed, but let’s be honest: <strong>this is boring, and it can lead to “non-natural” pieces of code</strong>, like in the previous example.</p>
<h3>Why CSS Logical Properties Are A Perfect Fit/Promising</h3>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-logical-1/">CSS Logical Properties</a> module comes into the game. The main idea of this CSS module is to have a <strong>logical abstraction</strong> that enables us to produce one layout that will adapt itself depending on the text direction and writing mode (properties like <code>writing-mode</code>, <code>direction</code>, and <code>text-orientation</code>, or <code>dir</code> attribute in HTML). This gives us possibilities like horizontal right-to-left or left-to-right, vertical RTL, and so on.</p>
Implementation In Practice
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>There are a few concepts to understand, already explained by Rachel Andrews here in “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/understanding-logical-properties-values/">Understanding Logical Properties And Values</a>”:</p>
<ul>
<li>We no longer think in terms of <code>left</code>/<code>right</code> but <code>start</code>/<code>end</code> (the same goes for <code>top</code>/<code>bottom</code>):</li>
<li>We no longer say <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> but instead <code>inline</code> and <code>block</code> — quite classical. (You’ve probably heard of default <code>inline</code> or <code>block</code> elements. 😉)</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea of <code>start</code>/<code>end</code> is not new. You use it probably every day with things like <code>justify-content: start</code>.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you now know — almost — everything! 🎉 Let’s see some practical examples.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the basics:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>width</code></td>
            <td><code>inline-size</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>height</code></td>
            <td><code>block-size</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>min-width</code></td>
            <td><code>min-inline-size</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>min-height</code></td>
            <td><code>min-block-size</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>max-width</code></td>
            <td><code>max-inline-size</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>max-height</code></td>
            <td><code>max-block-size</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Margins follow the same logic:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-top</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-bottom</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block-end</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-left</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-inline-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-right</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-inline-end</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The same goes for <code>padding</code>. Let’s move to the positioning:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>top</code></td>
            <td><code>inset-block-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>bottom</code></td>
            <td><code>inset-block-end</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>left</code></td>
            <td><code>inset-inline-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>right</code></td>
            <td><code>inset-inline-end</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Simple, isn’t it? <code>float</code>, <code>text-align</code>, and <code>border</code> follow the same path:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property/Value</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>float: left;</code></td>
            <td><code>float: inline-start;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>float: right;</code></td>
            <td><code>float: inline-end;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>text-align: left;</code></td>
            <td><code>text-align: start;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>text-align: right;</code></td>
            <td><code>text-align: end;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-top</code></td>
            <td><code>border-block-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-bottom</code></td>
            <td><code>border-block-end</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-left</code></td>
            <td><code>border-inline-start</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-right</code></td>
            <td><code>border-inline-end</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>I won’t detail some others like <code>resize</code> or <code>scroll-margin-top</code>, but instead, let’s look at the particular case of <code>border-radius</code>:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-top-left-radius</code></td>
            <td><code>border-start-start-radius</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-top-right-radius</code></td>
            <td><code>border-start-end-radius</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-bottom-left-radius</code></td>
            <td><code>border-end-start-radius</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>border-bottom-right-radius</code></td>
            <td><code>border-end-end-radius</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>A bit different, but easily understandable anyway.</p>
<p>Some possibilities with values are really cool — you can simplify some notations. Here are some further examples:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property/Value</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-left: auto;</code><br /> <code>margin-right: auto;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-inline: auto;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-top: 0;</code><br /> <code>margin-bottom: 0;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block: 0;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin-top: 1em;</code><br /> <code>margin-bottom: 2em;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block: 1em 2em;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>top: 0;</code><br /> <code>left: 0;</code><br /> <code>bottom: 0;</code><br /> <code>right: 0;</code></td>
            <td><code>inset: 0;</code> 🎉</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>left: 10%;</code><br /> <code>right: 10%;</code></td>
            <td><code>inset-inline: 10%;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is pure gold in the best world, right? Less code for perfect support of RTL languages! 🎉 </p>
<p>Now I’m sorry to brush away some of the stars in your eyes — there are indeed some limitations.</p>
<h3>Some Limitations</h3>
<h4>Missing Syntaxes</h4>
<p>CSS Logical Properties are quite new, even if the support is good on recent browsers. However, the CSS Logical Properties module is kind of “young” and needs a level 2. </p>
<p>To give a simple example: <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/main/packages/styles/scss/base/forms/_toggle.scss#L106">our toggle component</a> is using CSS transforms between different states (loading, active, and so on), mostly because <code>transform</code> is a reliable way to have fluid transitions or animations. </p>
<p>So, we have something like this: </p>
<pre><code>.element {
   transform: translateX(#{$toggle-width - $toggle-width-button});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there is <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1788">no flow-relative syntax for <code>transform</code></a>. So, we have to do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>[dir='rtl'] .element {
    transform: translateX(-#{$toggle-width - $toggle-width-button});
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to get an idea of missing stuff like this, you can check <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-logical-2">opened issues on CSS logical props</a>.</p>
<h4>Shorthand Properties</h4>
<p>Some shorthand notations are not supported for the moment, like the 2, 3, or 4 values for <code>margin</code>:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Classical Property/Value</th>
            <th>Logical Property</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin: 1em 2em;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block: 1em; /<em> top and bottom </em>/</code> <br /> <code>margin-inline: 2em /<em> left and right </em>/</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin: 1em 2em 3em;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block: 1em 3em; /<em> top, bottom </em>/</code> <br /> <code>margin-inline: 2em /<em> left, right </em>/</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>margin: 1em 2em 3em 4em;</code></td>
            <td><code>margin-block: 1em 3em; /<em> top, bottom </em>/</code> <br /> <code>margin-inline: 4em 2em /<em> left, right </em>/</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Don’t use these classic examples with logical needs. You will encounter issues as it’s actually not working. It’s better to be explicit. Also, it’s more readable, in my opinion.</p>
Showing Some Real Issues And Some Solutions
<h3>Images Where Reading Direction Is Important</h3>
<p>Some images have a direct meaning. Let’s take the example of theme cards:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/be125ff8-ca58-4db4-b261-9db9e32c17b4/smashing-themes-ltr.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, if we just apply RTL stuff to this, we would get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da4f9794-f58f-40d5-b994-85346d20bca4/smashing-themes-rtl-wrong.png" /></p>
<p>The order is RTL, but each image does not look like the interface of an RTL user. It’s the LTR version! In this case, it’s because the image reading direction conveys information.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c2093d6-542c-4100-b59e-87460d85a486/smashing-themes-rtl.png" /></p>
<p>We have a CSS class helper that makes it really simple to achieve this fix:</p>
<pre><code>[dir="rtl"] .on-rtl-mirror {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This also applies to any image with a reading direction, like an arrow or double chevron icon showing or pointing to something.</p>
<h3>Styles/Values Computed Via JavaScript</h3>
<p>Let’s imagine you have a plugin that calculates some positioning in JavaScript and provides the value you can use in JS or CSS. The dropdown library that we’re using provides only the <code>left</code> value in both RTL/LTR contexts, and <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/main/packages/styles/scss/components/_dropdown.scss#L18">we transfer to CSS</a> using a CSS Custom property.</p>
<p>So, if we were using this with Logical Properties, i.e. <code>inset-inline-start: calc(var(--left) * 1px);</code>, we would get the following by clicking on the user dropdown:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/11c74e25-e6ba-4941-b2eb-c62a8e21fb95/smashing-dropdown-positionned-badly.png" /></p>
<p>The solution is simple here. We keep the non-logical property:</p>
<pre><code>/* stylelint-disable */
top: calc(var(--top) * 1px);
left: calc(var(--left) * 1px); // JS provide left value only
/* stylelint-enable */
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7294a007-afdc-4c87-99e4-d4cae4e082f6/smashing-dropdown-positionned-correctly.png" /></p>
<p>And we disable our linting for this particular case.</p>
<h3>Mixing RTL And LTR content</h3>
<p>Even with the best CSS modules, anyone who has already made some RTL adaptations will say that mixing RTL and LTR content sometimes (often) gives crazy stuff. </p>
<p>Let’s take an example on Proton Drive with a component called <code>MiddleEllipsis</code>. The goal of this component is to apply ellipsis before the extension of the file to get something like <code>my-filename-blahblahblah…blah.jpg</code>.</p>
<p>Nothing crazy: we split the content into two parts and apply <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code> on the first one. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/main/packages/components/components/ellipsis/MiddleEllipsis.tsx">the source of this <code>MiddleEllipsis</code> component</a>. </p>
<p>Let’s apply some good ol’ RTL — we should then get the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/13d4f3a2-24e6-433e-9b20-d62e094c0210/smashing-drive-middle-ellipsis-done-wrong.png" /></p>
<p>Strange, right? This is simple to explain, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MiddleEllipsis</code> structure is RTL;</li>
<li>And we inject LTR content. (Remember, we did RTL-cut this LTR content.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The browser does its best, and what is displayed is not wrong from its point of view, but this makes no sense to a person. In this case, we chose to keep the LTR display to keep the purpose of the filenames but aligned it to the right:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7721d8c9-022c-4305-b7fa-3759ff9278ed/smashing-drive-middle-ellipsis-done-better.png" /></p>
<h3>Searching For Native LTR Patterns</h3>
<p>The <code>MiddleEllipsis</code> example showed that if user-generated content is LTR, then it’s better to display it as LTR. </p>
<p>But we can wonder if there are some patterns that are naturally LTR. The short answer is yes. Below you can find an example.</p>
<h4>Phone Number</h4>
<p>The phone number might be the most obvious case here as it’s usually using western numbers, which are meant to be read LTR.</p>
<p>If we apply Logical props directly to it, it might give the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/14c80d39-c7e3-49bf-98d1-7c1c7cdc2871/smashing-phone-rtl-wrong.png" /></p>
<p>While it’s technically not false, it’s a bit weird to display <code>+33 6 12 34 56 78</code> like this. In this case, we decided to keep the LTR alignment by default to avoid this strange result.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0202bcc9-9f95-4e02-8703-dfd75fc699d1/smashing-phone-rtl.png" /></p>
<p>We have the same case for a 2FA input using western numbers. We don’t yet have the case but imagine a 4-part input to enter an IP address. This would not make sense to display it fully RTL as people would understand <code>1.0.163.192</code> instead of <code>192.163.0.1</code>.</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>The biggest issue we faced was mostly in regards to compatibility. This can be seen on <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-logical-props">Can I Use tables for Logical Props</a>: </p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/90118ebb-00fd-4254-98fa-5aeb78a0ca4c/smashing-can-i-use-table-logical-properties.png" /></p>
<p>If the target is only recent modern browsers, there is no problem. But if there is a need for older versions of Safari, for example, the support is pretty bad. And in this case, CSS Logical Properties are not gracefully degraded. Thus everything might look broken.</p>
<p>Several options are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve a CSS build for modern browsers and another one for older ones;</li>
<li>Transpile everything for each case.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Proton’s case, as we were not totally ready to ship an RTL language when we merged it, and for other reasons, the decision was taken to transpile everything to good ol’ classical CSS properties. Recently, we found <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/commit/ccc35cc6e7769a426702d94aebb8d213abda3252">a solution</a> for one case that did need RTL support for Farsi language (VPN account):</p>
<ol>
<li>We build two CSS files: one modern with Logical props and one legacy;</li>
<li>We load the modern one;</li>
<li>We test the correct support of <code>border-start-start-radius</code>;</li>
<li>If it’s not supported, we fall back to legacy.</li>
</ol>
Conclusion
<p>Even if absolute perfection is out of this world, moving to CSS Logical properties is <strong>a really interesting move and a good bet for the future</strong>: we write less code with these CSS Logical Props, and we reduce the amount of future work by using them, so it really goes in an exciting direction.</p>
<p>As the last takeaway, and even if it would need more work, we did some tests of a vertical RTL display to test further CSS Logical properties.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c5bac605-24bb-42dd-a649-c616f85f9de7/smashing-vertical-experiment.png" /></p>
<p>Looks quite interesting, doesn’t it? 😉</p>

<p>This article is ideal for your lunch break. It highlights seven quite straightforward (dare I even say simple) graphic communication problems. I then expand on them, showing the problem, remedy, and what can be learned. It will give you an insight into accessibility, also the easily looked-over area of access structures, and usability showing that they are a major factor in so many things, like design, communication, technology, objects, and systems. But we are not done there — I will also help you think about some new ways to make your designs much better and help you consider some aspects that you have never even considered before on your current projects, right now, today.</p>
Adding A Basic Scroll Bar To A User Interface Menu Makes Items Easier To Find And Use
<p>If we look at the menu by clicking on the <em>Fonts</em> drop-down menu in Microsoft Word Mac version 16 or any version of Microsoft Word, we can see that everything looks normal:</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/76aee7fa-828f-4a81-84f2-446c005e57e0/scroll-v1-large.png" /></p>
<p>There is a list of fonts installed on the computer in alphabetical order. However, when we go to perform a task using the menu, like going to the font Verdana at the end of the list, we have to move our mouse all the way down to the bottom of the menu list, then hover over the <em>down arrow</em>, then wait 3 or 4 seconds, or more, until it gets to the bottom of the menu, near <em>V</em>, before we can select Verdana. Yes, we could also type the font name at the top, but maybe you are not sure what font you want to use or what it is called.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>It takes many seconds to get to a font that is below B or at the end of the list; the current solution does not allow quick access. Furthermore, if you make a mistake, or your mouse goes off the menu, or if you are not able to control the mouse cursor that well, it will cause the menu to close, and then you have to start this interaction all over again, because if the mouse goes off or clicks out of the menu, it closes it. These issues are certainly not ideal for most of us who are busy and who want to get things done quickly and efficiently, like designers.</p>
<p>The problem of not having a scroll bar is often experienced in website vertical or side-navigation menus (sidenavs). The side-navigation menus might not even need to have a scroll bar, as the content inside the menu is not larger than the vertical screen height. However, if the website or smartphone browser is made a lot shorter vertically in height, there is often no scroll bar shown. So, you cannot scroll to the end of the side navigation’s content within the menu, and you might not even know to try to scroll more vertically, as no scroll bar is shown. Not ideal or great, hey?</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>One of the things that would be really easy to do, and is found a lot in software user interfaces and websites, is to add a simple scroll bar to the right of the font menu. How difficult is that to do? Not very. This would allow users to scroll more quickly to the font they want, reducing the time to find and select a font in the menu by at least half (50%). Why do they not do this? I am not really sure.</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>If the software developers and user interface designers used a scroll bar to the right of the font menu, it would allow users to find any font much quicker, increase workflow productivity, reduce stress, confusion, and enable a much quicker and better interaction. Audit, test users, and find out what people want to do, or else you cannot be sure you have effectively designed the thing. Maybe you are not even aware of the ways users want to use your design, communication, object, or system. That is why it is so important to understand the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What people will want to do with your thing;</li>
<li>Different people will want to use your design, information, and communication in different ways;</li>
<li>Different people will want to achieve different things.</li>
</ul>
Better Font Software = Faster, Easier, And Better Results
<p>As another example, if we compare font organizing software like Font Book on a Mac or the Fonts option in Control Panel on Windows. Yes, we have these two types of software, but do you actually use them to install fonts, or do you install them manually by copying the font files into the Fonts folders? Do you use them to view, compare, and get information about fonts? Can you use this software to manage, organize, and share fonts for your design team? Probably not, as they lack the features.</p>
<p>Well, the creative folks at <a href="https://www.extensis.com/?utm_source=smashingmag&amp;utm_medium=aff&amp;utm_campaign=review">Extensis</a> have created just what you need: <strong>Connect Fonts</strong>. It is clearly better than Font Book on a Mac or the Fonts option in Control Panel on Windows for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a better display of a font’s glyphs;</li>
<li>It shows the name of the glyph, Unicode value, and Glyph ID;</li>
<li>It has a better grid display, QuickType, Waterfall, ABC 123, and punctuation (many of these options are not available in Font Book);</li>
<li>Connect Fonts is a more advanced and technology-advanced software than Font Book on a Mac, or the Fonts option in Control Panel on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/54717f51-64b8-483f-8241-84728d22a81e/5-connecting-fonts-extensis.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here are additional features not offered by Font Book on a Mac or the Fonts option in Control Panel on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a font vault that is a single, secure, managed repository for all your fonts;</li>
<li>Sort options for all fonts (Name, Postscript Name, Type, Foundry, Class, Family, Version, Font Sense, Classification, Activation, Favourites, Date Added, Location);</li>
<li>Add Google Fonts;</li>
<li>Manage Adobe Creative Cloud fonts;</li>
<li>Zoom in and out;</li>
<li>All glyph panels and search;</li>
<li>Glyph information (Name, Unicode, Glyph ID, Keystrokes);</li>
<li>View categories of glyphs (Entire Font (123 Glyphs), Alphabetic Presentation Forms, Basic Latin, Combining Diacritical Marks, Currency Symbols, Cyrillic, General Punctuation, Geometric Shapes, Greek and Coptic, Latin Extended Additional, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, Latin-1 Supplement, Letterlike Symbols, Mathematical Operators, Number Forms, Spacing Modifier Letters, Superscripts and Subscripts);</li>
<li>Desktop and online in browser versions, both connected;</li>
<li>Cloud libraries and synchronize fonts;</li>
<li>Setup team libraries across desktop and online versions;</li>
<li>Share any digital files and documents;</li>
<li>Font analytics and reports;</li>
<li>Full admin account settings;</li>
<li>Very useful for large organizations to control fonts available for use and to manage permissions and rights;</li>
<li>Add tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works with Adobe Creative Cloud, Sketch, Affinity Designer/Photo/Publisher;</li>
<li>View and preview fonts (Tile, QuickType, Waterfall and customized Waterfall, ABC 123, and punctuation).</li>
</ul>
Use ‘Access Structures’ To Excel Your Communication Success
<p>An annual review gives interested people information about the business, charity, or organization, promotes what they do, and showcases what they have done in the last year to shareholders and other interested people. We designed an annual review (a printed publication showcasing a charity’s achievements, news, and financial activities for the year) more than ten years ago.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>One of the standout issues that we soon realized from reading, laying out, and designing the annual review, was that there were many mentions of different towns within a country, mentioned throughout the text in the annual review, that the charity supports and works with. However, there was no easy or obvious way to know where they were or how to envisage where they were.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>What was missing that the client had not done or envisaged in the past? A map on the inside back flap of the publication showing where the different towns were within the main country. It is not rocket science — maybe even just good old common sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/608e1f89-b9df-45bc-984b-2652ce170d48/7-connecting-fonts-extensis.png" /></p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>Can you see what we are doing? We tried to envisage and dig out what people will want to do with the thing and see if there is anything we can do to make the communication better, more accessible, and usable, and to better describe and help people to use the annual review. The annual review could have been an electronic PDF or HTML — the same problems exist whatever media. But would you have envisaged or thought about adding a map that the client never even thought about or even asked for? Sometimes, designers have to go the extra mile and push the boat out for their clients in need.</p>
<p>This issue of making information easier to understand and consciously helping people to understand and use it by adding clever features, in this case, a map, has to do with the area of <em>accessibility</em>. It could easily be considered <em>usability</em> because it makes the information and publication more usable; however, it is more about the area of accessibility. Being even more precise and specific, it has to do with things called <strong>access structures</strong>, as highlighted in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-0994-9_11">1979</a> by information designer and educator <a href="https://www.robwaller.org">Robert Waller</a> who runs the <a href="https://www.simplificationcentre.org.uk/">Simplification Centre</a> and who has been the Professor of Information Design between 2007–2011 at the well-known <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/">Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the University of Reading</a> in the United Kingdom, just outside London. In the <a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty/36">JS Party (Episode #36)</a> podcast Suz Hinton, Safia Abdalla and Kevin Ball have also highlighted that there is more to accessibility than a disability people may have, and what devices they may use to help them.</p>
<p><em>Access structures</em> are not commonly talked about in the now huge and popular <em>world of accessibility</em>. Yes, we talk of people, their physical issues (vision impairment, aging, dyslexia, physical disabilities, and so on), or what supportive devices they may use to make things easier (magnifying glass, screenreader, vision impairment stick, and so on), or even what legal issues and implications there might be because of bad accessibility. But we rarely talk about adding elements like <em>access structures</em> to help people with their content comprehension, processing and reading style strategies, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse;</li>
<li>Skim/preview;</li>
<li>Search/scan;</li>
<li>Intense study;</li>
<li>Review.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to just expand a bit more (if I may?), maybe you have used the audio hosting website <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>. Among many of its great features, it has a search option just the same as any other search option, a horizontal box, then a search button (so nothing unusual or out of the ordinary here yet). It allows users to search through the whole website and content rather than having to go through and read millions of web pages (well, you knew that anyway). Expanding a bit more, when you search, it of course, returns the search results in a vertical list, just like a search on Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. However, on the left of the search results webpage are some really interesting and very useful search refinement options, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything</strong><br />The user’s search term searches through everything and the below.</li>
<li><strong>SoundCloud Go+ tracks</strong><br />If selected, will only search through this offline and ad-free listening service from Soundcloud. There are then two further sub-search filter options:<ul>
<li>Added any time,</li>
<li>Any length.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tracks</strong><br />Apply user’s search to just audio content. There are then three further sub-search filter options:<ul>
<li>Added any time,</li>
<li>Any length,</li>
<li>To listen to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>People</strong><br />Apply user’s search to just people, for example, user/profile account names. There are then nine further sub-search filter options that somehow seem to know the countries associated with your search:<ul>
<li>Location. (9 country names associated with your search.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Albums</strong><br />Apply user’s search to albums, for example, collected tracks within a grouped album option. They are then filtered by tag options:<ul>
<li>Electronic,</li>
<li>Techno,</li>
<li>Hip-Hop &amp; Rap,</li>
<li>Drum &amp; Bass,</li>
<li>House,</li>
<li>Ambient,</li>
<li>Electronica,</li>
<li>Dance &amp; EDM,</li>
<li>Deep House.    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Playlists</strong><br />Apply user’s search to user-curated playlists collection, once again with the previous filter by tag options:<ul>
<li>Same as previous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you might think, well, this is all fairly standard and default stuff. However, not only is a user able to search for something; they are then given many very handy and useful <strong>sub-access structures</strong> that are very helpful in allowing them to further refine and edit their search term. I cannot stress how useful and important this is. This is basically the definition and whole bowls of what design, accessibility, usability, information, and communication are together.</p>
<p>Think about it. What would you do, and what would the result be if you could only perform a search, i.e. just search for something and then had no further refinement options? Users would not able to further refine what they are trying to do and achieve.</p>
Providing An Electronic Business Card Increases The Chance Of Being Contacted And Getting New Business
<p>I run a graphic communication design and text editing business in the United Kingdom called <a href="https://www.userdesignillustrationandtypesetting.com/">User Design, Illustration, and Typesetting</a>, working for book publishers and also other types of organizations. We also do information design, user testing, website design, and research. We contact quite a lot of art, design, and production managers at U.K. book publishers, and one of the things we realized about seven years ago, is that they get a lot of emails every day from people offering the same services and making the same inquiry as us. </p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>We realized that we need to increase the chance and any chance of our business’s details being <em>used</em> and <em>spread</em>, at and within their organization, and by whatever communication method they use, typically a computer, from staff-to-staff or colleague-to-colleague, to ultimately increase the chance of them contacting us (this is the goal anyway while the reality is another matter, but keep reading).</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>What we did, and it is really simple and easy to do (but we hardly ever see anyone do it), we made a link available to a digital business card in PDF, PNG, RTF, and vCard formats, on our <em>homepage</em> and <em>contact us</em> webpages. Do you provide a business card on your website, portfolio, or client’s website? Probably not. It is these types of things we need to try and realize and find out as designers because it improves the chances of communication success, and the ultimate end objective that was <em>to get people to make an inquiry and contact us</em> (an action).</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>By making our main contact details more easily available and reusable, and in different electronic formats, it makes it quicker and easier to share and exchange our details, and also in different types of software (remember, not all of us like to use the same software program or system) thus leading to more chance of people in organizations contacting us (well, I have already said that three times). Would you have thought of this? How can you apply this to the project you are currently working on? Furthermore, the next important question is how can you <em>measure</em> if it is working and having an impact, or indeed if it is not? It is very important in design and communication to actually know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is working and what is not;</li>
<li>What areas could be optimized and what areas could be better;</li>
<li>Or what areas are not working well and are underperforming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basing design success measurements on what people think or feel is highly subjective, and soooooooooo last century.</p>
The Fastest Internet Speed In 2022 Is Still 4 kbps
<p>Current times in 2022 are challenging throughout the world (there is no denying that). Over the last few years, we have noticed the truly awful impact, performance, and results of websites for users, because of lazy loading images, infinite scroll, and content shifting on page load to save on internet data bandwidth usage — both on the user’s end and server-side (that delivers the website).</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>In essence, lazy loading means that an image or content will not be loaded until it becomes available or requested by the user in the visible screen area. Because of this lazy (late) loading, users frequently have to wait a few seconds for content to load, even with today’s amazing technology.</p>
<p>Infinite scroll is essentially the same principle as lazy load images, but the non-visible vertical webpage content not in the screen’s visible screen area, is not loaded until you scroll down. Lazy load can also be used with painful pagination features (like go to page 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as seen on large e-commerce websites and as Vitaly Friedman has outlined in his article, “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/designing-better-infinite-scroll/">Perfect Infinite Scroll UX</a>”).</p>
<p>Content shifting on page load basically refers to a mixture of lazy loading content (text, images, and webpage layout) being delayed and loaded late, causing the content, when it does load, to load late, shifting the vertical and horizontal height of the web page’s content, cause elements and call-to-action buttons to shift and move around, as also highlighted by <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/ways-to-reduce-content-shifting-on-page-load/">Michael Scharnagl</a> on Smashing Magazine. This issue is especially problematic if you are trying to work quickly on a slowish or sluggish machine or device. However, not even a fast machine seems to make a difference regarding this issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/83dcca80-24b2-4936-968e-d52bdf9bd83c/6-connecting-fonts-extensis.png" /></p>
<p>All of these three issues create really bad user interactions, especially with longer-length web pages, although they are promoted and regarded as good webpage performance techniques.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p><strong>Give people the content when it should be there and when they need it, as fast as you can</strong>. I understand that for very long webpages, some off-visible screen lazy loading and infinite scroll could be beneficial to save on unnecessary loading of content. But for everything else, just give it to users as fast as possible experience. We have incredible technology these days, and let’s not over-design and overthink.</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>It could be said that when using lazy loading or infinite scroll in 2022, we are still dialing up with 4 kbps modems just like we did back in the year 2000. The amount of times and the delivery of information and images is the same: very, very slow. Nothing has changed. We are still looking at blank or block-colored images waiting for them to load... while 20 years of the internet have passed. The average speed of a computer and mobile internet in 2022 is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/896779/average-mobile-fixed-broadband-download-upload-speeds/">30.78 mbps</a>, and we are still getting the same performance as in the year 2000 — as if on 4 kbps modems. User experience is what matters, not technical wizardry.</p>
Total Overload Of User’s First Website Interaction
<p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/26cc8a8a-b496-4c52-8634-7f2406ad21e1/20-useful-accessibility-usability-examples-help-improve-your-designs.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Another example of bad usability is webpages that have very demanding <em>first-visit user requirements</em>. I am sure you all experience and struggle with the following on a daily basis (maybe you are even doing it now, arghhhh go away cookie policy box? Yes, no?):</p>
<ol>
<li>Cookie policy “accept/deny warning box” pops up when you 1st visit a webpage that distracts and blocks natural use.</li>
<li>Email newsletter box pops up asking if you want to subscribe. That is another thing you have to do, even before you have started to use and read the webpage!</li>
<li>A “do you want to receive update/news notifications” box appears.</li>
<li>“Do you want to allow or block access to your physical location” box appears.</li>
<li>Another box appears asking if you want to save 50% if you order in the next three days.</li>
<li>A chat box appears asking if you want to chat with someone [well, maybe, but not at the moment].</li>
<li>Then, finally, a “do you want to save your password” box appears.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Do not overcomplicate the 1st interaction with your thing. It is a bit like comparing it to bumping into someone when you are in a hurry and have to go, and all they keep doing is talking to you and telling you their life story. If people find their 1st interaction with you displeasing, they will turn away. If you have to provide options like cookie warning boxes, email newsletter subscribe boxes, and other notifications, leave them optional or in a place that everyone knows they can visit, like a universal <em>options</em> link or button in the top right of a webpage, where they can customize and setup these things, as they like.</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>All of this creates a hard-to-use and over-demanding graphic communication. That distracts, over-complicates, and creates extra barriers to information that are very costly for your business or organization because it increases the chance of your users leaving and rejecting your item. Say goodbye to your users and customers in less than 3 seconds. It gives your brand a bad feeling and experience, and maybe they decide not to order something through your website. These are the everyday realities of bad usability because of your over-demanding and difficult-to-use design, information, and communication. It is not difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about how people will want to use your design.</li>
<li>Make it as easy and least demanding as possible.</li>
<li>Test with them in real time.</li>
</ul>
Clothing Measurement Sizes On Fashion E-commerce
<p>The next example has to do with measurements such as millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), and inches (in). It doesn’t bring that much confusion with it, but surprisingly, it can still cause quite a lot of confusion and problems worldwide.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Measurements such as millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm) and inches (in) may not seem that interesting, but if you were to try to order a polo t-shirt online, you’ll notice that it may take you longer to do than expected. By measuring the width between your armpits across your breast area to get your bust (chest) circumference, and you may have measured 60 cm on the front, and you have to multiply this number by 2 for the whole circumference of 60 cm (front) × 2 (front and back) to get a result of 120 cm.</p>
<p>Let’s say you finally find a polo t-shirt that you really like on a French clothing e-commerce website. You choose the color of the polo t-shirt you like and search for your size (we know that it is 120 cm, this sounds like we’re back in a Maths class, bear with me), but the only available sizes from that French clothing company are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 – XS</li>
<li>3 – S</li>
<li>4 – M</li>
<li>5 – L</li>
<li>6 – XL</li>
<li>7 – XXL</li>
<li>8 – 3XL</li>
<li>9 – 4XL</li>
<li>10 – 5XL</li>
<li>11 – 6XL</li>
</ul>
<p>The above measurements are a bit helpful but certainly not accurate. They are not accurate because there is still no measurement information in millimeters, centimeters, or inches. However, below the information above is a link titled <em>Size guide</em>. Okay, let's give that a go and see what it does. A slide-in panel appears, and there is a drop-down list with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 – XS = (bust circumference: 87 cm/34 in, pant waist circumference: 73 cm/28 inch).</li>
<li>3 – S = (bust circumference: 90–93 cm/35–37 in, pant waist circumference: 77–81 cm/30–31 in).</li>
<li>4 – M = (bust circumference: 97–101 cm/38–40 in, pant waist circumference: 85–89 cm/33–35 in).</li>

<li>10 – 5XL = that now, strangely, in the <em>Size guide</em> slide-in panel seems to say 1XG = (bust circumference: 139 cm/55 in, pant waist circumference: 131 cm/52 in).</li>
<li>11 – 6XL = that now, strangely, in the <em>Size guide</em> slide-in panel seems to say 2XG = (bust circumference: 144 cm/57 in, pant waist circumference: 136 cm/54 in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you starting to get a headache? I told you, keep reading and we will find the remedy!</p>
<p>Our bust (chest) circumference, as we know, is 120 cm, so it seems by the information in the above <em>Size guide</em> panel, that this size (entry):</p>
<ul>
<li>7 – XXL = (bust circumference: 121–125 cm / 48–49 in, pant waist circumference: 111–116 cm/44–46 in).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is going to be a really good and safe size (because it is slightly larger than 120 cm by 1–4 cm). So it seems that there is no problem here, and in fact, the website has given good and flexible information because measurement sizes have been provided in three different measurements: <code>cm</code>, <code>mm</code> (can be worked out quite easily), and <code>in</code>.</p>
<p>Another related question is whether all clothing websites display their polo t-shirts measurement like the French clothing company above. Well, no. Here is an example from a British clothing company, and we are going to use our pre-measured bust (chest) circumference, which we know is 120 cm once again, to order a different polo t-shirt from the British clothing company. So I have selected a polo t-shirt from the British clothing company’s e-commerce website, and the sizes that it gives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>36</li>
<li>38</li>
<li>40</li>
<li>42</li>
<li>44</li>
<li>46</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at the drop-down list information from the French clothing company, we really cannot see anything that says 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46. However, once again, there is a <em>View guide</em> link on this British clothing website, so we click that, and see what happens (as it might be able to give us some more information).</p>
<p>Two options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top half (bust, chest),</li>
<li>Bottom half (waist).</li>
</ul>
<p>We want the <em>Top half (bust, chest)</em> option because we measured the distance from armpit-to-armpit, then multiplied by 2 to give our total circumference in cm, as previously. The tables say:</p>
<p><strong>Top half (bust, chest)</strong></p>

<p>We have to remember that the only available sizes in this polo t-shirt are 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, and 46. So it would seem 46 is the largest size they offer, and the circumference in cm of 46 (inches circumference) is 117 cm circumference. As you can see, 117 cm is not large enough. There is not enough flex (leeway) in this size because we know that our already measured armpit-to-armpit circumference in cm is 120 cm.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The French clothing company provided a good range of measurements in 2 measurements, inches and cm. The British clothing company, however, provided two tables, and it would be more advisable to actually not offer users the second table because it is basically a whole range table for all their clothing and is not valid for the polo t-shirt we selected, where only 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 were available (yes, it is confusing). If we really want to clarify even more, the initial sizes of 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, and 46 would maybe be better written like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>36 in (92 cm), 38 in (97 cm), 40 in (102 cm), 42 in (107 cm), 44 in (112 cm), 46 in (117 cm).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is much less misunderstanding, and users can relate the values better to their information and size.</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can learn a lot. The interesting points to note are that the French clothing company’s website offered fairly useful and practical information. The British clothing company initially gave us six measurements in inches (36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46) that made no sense to us, but when we went to the <em>View guide</em> link, we were able to decode the two tables, although it really was not made <em>blatant</em> (obvious enough) that this range only goes up to 46 inches bust (chest) circumference. And in fact, there were two tables provided, and it could have been very easy to read the second table (one below) and see that there is a size of XXL (119–124). Since the table has been provided, it will be available in XXL (119–124), but, of course, it is not for the polo t-shirt we selected.</p>
<p>Only give information relevant to the product and task, and remove any information that is not applicable or useful, especially when dealing with measurements. Furthermore, and you are going to like this if you are a designer or working in sales, if we consider the <em>further-down-the-line</em> consequences, you could very easily, as people do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an order thinking the size will be alright when really it is not (we have all done this, hey).</li>
<li>Type in all your details.</li>
<li>Pay for it.</li>
<li>Wait for it to be delivered (maybe missing a day of work, or picking it up from somewhere else, as no one was in where you live).</li>
<li>Try it on, and it does not fit.</li>
<li>Get packaging to return it to them undamaged.</li>
<li>Complete another refund/return form.</li>
<li>Do more paperwork.</li>
<li>Send it back to them (maybe missing a day of work, so someone can pick it up from where you live or travel to a post/courier office).</li>
<li>Check your bank account over the next 30 days to see if you have been refunded.</li>
<li>Oh, I forgot, what about writing the postal address that the return needs to go to? Do you write it on the front in a pen, print out an A4 page, then sellotape it on, or do you do something else?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, user errors and mistakes are very time-consuming for the users themselves, and even more costly for the supplier of the product who has to process the return, i.e. giving them masses of more work to do. Good design makes a lot of sense for all involved.</p>
Concluding Observations, What Did We Learn From All Of The Examples?

<li>Increase customer loyalty and quality perception of the brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Have Explored And Learned In This Article</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Word Font Menu</strong><br />Rather than accepting a design and what is there, we understood and found out how people will want to use the thing. We then looked at a very simple solution to make this as quick and efficient as possible. It leads to increased workflow speed, productivity, better actions, and a reduction in time, stress, and confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Font Software</strong><br />We saw default operating software that lacked needed features.</li>
<li><strong>Map In An Annual Review</strong><br />We found out, explored, and understood how people are going to use the thing, interface, content, or system. We then provided a very simple map that improves access to the content to allow easier and more chance of comprehending the information, and to increase the chance of people doing what we intend and enabling it to happen more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic Business Card On Websites</strong><br />We were able to increase the chances of people doing something (in our case, to contact us) by thinking about how we could make that easier to do by providing different electronic files to help people do this.</li>
<li><strong>Modern (considered) good practice web performance techniques</strong><br />Current-day website design performance methods, like lazy load and infinite scroll, are rendering websites to load at 4 kbps speeds that we had around the year 2000, that is 22 years ago. This makes websites difficult to use and interferes with the user’s original intention and goal.</li>
<li><strong>Total Overload Of User’s First Interaction</strong><br />We saw many websites requiring a user’s first interaction to deal with, sometimes, 13 option settings and sorting, before they even get a chance to engage and complete their original task. Showing a high amount of information overload and digital information pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Seemingly Straightforward And Assumed Easily Usable Information</strong><br />When it comes to information, even seemingly very mundane and standard information (if it is not designed, communicated, and provided to users in a logical and easy way) creates masses of problems and work for all involved (as was the case in the online polo t-shirt ordering examples).</li>
